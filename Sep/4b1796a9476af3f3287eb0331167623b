Senate President Bukola Saraki has confirmed that he has received the ministerial list from President Muhammadu Buhari. Saraki through his twitter handle said he received the list about 5p.m on Wednesday. “I can confirm to you that I have just received the list,” he tweeted. The list was conveyed by the Chief of Staff to the President, Alhaji Abba Kyari and Senator Ita Inang, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate). It would be recalled that Buhari had promised to submit the list by the end of September. The list was sent after the Senate ended plenary for September 30.
