  ISESELE EZEKIEL, Benin The leadership of Edo State Chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday described as enemies of progress, all those who opposed the approval of loans for further development of the state. The party therefore appealed to the good people of Edo State to ignore such individuals and groups as they do not mean well for the people In a press statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Comrade Godwin Erhahon, the party noted, “It is disturbing to note that some mercenaries who pose as human rights activists became notorious for their frequent attempts at misleading the public against the state government which has continued to succeed where PDP failed. “Such uncivil and unpatriotic organizations only expose their incivility as agents of darkness. Why should a civil society organization support PDP to oppose the approval of N3.167billion loans for Edo State government while PDP-controlled states such as Kogi  received N50.842billion, Ondo – N14.686billion, Delta – N10.036billion and Cross Rivers  –  N7.856billion. “So far, Edo State remains one of the few states of the federation that does not borrow money to pay salaries because the Comrade Governor has continued to manage its meagre resources most prudently.” He said, “Only agents of darkness would refuse to acknowledge both the completed and on-going development projects across the state.” Comrade Erhahon therefore assured Edo people that the on-going erosion-controlled projects across the state would be completed during the forthcoming dry season.
