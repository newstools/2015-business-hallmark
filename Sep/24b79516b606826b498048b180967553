A Federal High Court, Abuja, on Tuesday granted bail to former National Security Adviser (NSA), retired Col. Mohammed Sambo Dasuki, arraigned before the court for illegal possession of firearms. Justice Adeniyi Ademola granted Dasuki bail on self-recognition, after he pleaded not guilty. However, the judge directed Dasuki to submit his passport to the Deputy Chief Registrar of the court. The Department of State Service (DSS) arraigned the former NSA on a one-count charge of illegal possession of arms, contrary to Section 27(1Ai) of the Firearms Act of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Prosecution Counsel, Mr Mohammed Diri, told the court that during a search on the accused personâ€™s residence on July 16, the items were found in his possession. They include -five Tavor assault rifles, 20 magazine ammunitions, small magazine containing 16 rounds of ammunitions and bigger magazine containing live ammunitions, among others. Sambo pleaded not guilty to the charge. The court adjourned the case till October 26 and 27 for hearing. It would be recalled that operatives of the DSS on July 16 raided the accused residence and found the items after he had handed over. (NAN)
