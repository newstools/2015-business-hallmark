The National Examination Council (NECO) has released the June/July 2015 results with improvement of 16 percent in credits in English and Mathematics.
The NECO registrar, Prof. Abdulrashid Garba, who announced the results on Thursday in Minna, said that 68.56 percent of candidates got more than five credits this year.
He said that the 2015 result was an improvement from 2014 when 52.29 percent got above five credits.
Garba said that 969,491 sat for the examination out of the 969,991 candidates that registered.
He said that 0.11 percent cases of malpractice were recorded, adding that the results of candidates involved have been cancelled.
The registrar said that the council was able to sustain its timely release of results in less than 60 days from the date the last paper was written.
“The 2015 examinations result was released within 60 days after the final paper. This shows a great success achieved by the council.
“Lists of schools which were involved in examination malpractice have been blacklisted and the results of students who wrote in such centres have been cancelled,” he said.
Garba called on candidates who sat for the examination to access their results on NECO web site www.mynecoexams.com. (NAN)
