 A leader of the All Progressives Congress in Bayelsa State and former Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party, Col. Sam Inokoba (retd), is dead. Inokoba, who on Saturday, August 15, 2015, led other PDP heavyweights and faithful to defect to the APC, died in the early hours of Wednesday. It was learnt that the APC leader died at the age of 66, a month to his 67th birthday, at the Military Cantonment Hospital, Ikeja, Lagos State. Though the cause of his death has yet to be known, a source very close to the retired Colonel said in confidence that Inokoba died of food poisoning. Before his demise, Inokobaâ€™s health had been generating some concerns as he was alleged to have slumped on some occasions at public functions. Meanwhile, former President Goodluck Jonathan, former Governor of Bayelsa State, Chief D.S.P. Alamieyeseigha, Ijaw leaders and other political heavyweights from the South-South are among dignitaries that will attend the second term declaration of Bayelsa State governor, Mr. Seriake Dickson Others expected at the event scheduled for September 8 in Yenagoa are the national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), PDP governors and National Assembly members. Alamieyeseigha described Dickson as a good product that will be easy to market for a second tenure in office. He spoke when Dickson visited him at his country home in Amassoma community in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area. According to the former governor, Dickson has performed well and deserves a second tenure to consolidate on the gains of the restoration agenda.
