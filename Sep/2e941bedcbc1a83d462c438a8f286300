Interim President Michel Kafando of Burkina Faso said he had reassumed his duties on Wednesday, a week after he was ousted by the presidential guard, plunging the West African country into crisis.
The transitional government that was in place after the ouster of president Blaise Compaore nearly a year ago “is back and resumes the exercise of the power of state at this very minute,” Kafando said on national television.
The 1,200-strong presidential guard took Kafando, interim Prime Minister Isaac Zida and two ministers captive. Kafando and the two ministers were released a few days later and Zida on Monday.
There was no comment from Gilbert Diendere, the brigadier general leading the coup, who was seen welcoming the presidents of Ghana, Niger and Benin as they arrived in Ouagadougou to mediate in the crisis.
Other leaders including the Togolese president and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo of Nigeria were expected later in the day.
The presidential guard and the loyalist army signed an agreement to end the hostilities late Tuesday, according to radio station Omega FM.
The presidential guard agreed to remain confined to barracks, while the loyalists said they would retreat to 50 kilometres from Ouagadougou, as part of the deal.
The deal was struck after the army started mobilizing against the presidential guard, with soldiers and tanks seen on the streets in Ouagadougou.
Discussing the crisis at a summit in Nigeria on Tuesday, leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) did not mention an amnesty for the coup leaders nor allowing Compaore loyalists to contest the upcoming elections, which had been among the key demands of the presidential guard.
Compaore fled to Ivory Coast in October 2014 following massive protests against his plans to extend his 27-year rule.
The transitional period that followed was to culminate in elections set for October 11.
ECOWAS mediators have proposed November 22 as a new election date. (dpa)
