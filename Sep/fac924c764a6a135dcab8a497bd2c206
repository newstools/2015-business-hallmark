Former President Goodluck Jonathan on Wednesday said that the death of Hannah Idowu Dideolu Awolowo, the wife of the late Obafemi Awolowo, former premier of the old Western region, forced him out of self-imposed 12- month solitude. He said he had planned to remain disconnected from social and political activities in the country for at least one year after leaving office on May 29. He added that since he‎ handed over power to President Muhammadu Buhari on May 29, 2015, he and his wife, Patience, had planned to stay off political and social issues in the country, but the national importance of Awolowo’s family, particularly the deceased, had forced him out to join many Nigerians to mourn HID Awolowo, who he described as the mother of the nation. Jonathan, who was ushered into Awolowo’s residence in Ikenne, Ogun State, by Gbenga Daniel, ex-governor, Ogun State ‎and Tola Oyediran, eldest daughter of HID in company of his wife, Patience; Mulikat Adeola Akande, ex-House Reps majority leader, Jimi Ogunsiji, ex-chairman, FERMA and others, mourned the death of the deceased, explaining that it was a rare privilege that HID used additional 29 years on normal Biblical three scores and ten.
