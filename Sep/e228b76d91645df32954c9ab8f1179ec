The Legislative Houses Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Jos on Saturday upheld the election of Sen. Jonah Jang of the PDP as senator representing Plateau North Senatorial District in the National Assembly. Mrs Ayisa Sambo of APC had filed a petition seeking to nullify the return of Jang by INEC as winner of the March 28 Plateau North senatorial polls. The three-member tribunal presided over by Justice Justice O.O. Akeredolu dismissed the petition for lacking in merit. The tribunal held that the petitioners failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubts. Delivering the judgment, Justice Akeredolu said that the witnesses presented by the petitioners only testified on hearsay, as they were not present at the polling units on the day of the election. She further held that the evidences presented by the petitioners were not properly certified, hence could not “hold-sway’’. “The allegation of over-voting, which is criminal, as presented before this honourable court against the first respondent was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. “Therefore, the petition failed in its entirety and it is hereby dismissed for lack of merit,” she ruled. Akeredolu ordered that a compensation of N200,000 each, be paid to Jang and the PDP. Sunday Oyawole, counsel to Jang, said the judgment was well considered and in accordance with the laws of the land. (NAN)
