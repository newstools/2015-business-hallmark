Security operatives attached to Justice Gabriel Kolawole at the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Tuesday prevented Charles Okah, the alleged mastermind of the 2010 Independence Day bombing from committing suicide in court. Okah, who is standing trial on charges of terrorism, had sought the permission of the judge to speak on what he termed “endless trial”, as his counsel was absent in court. The judge granted the oral application and permitted Okah to speak for about five minutes. Okah said “I have been incarcerated for about five years now and I have a family to cater for. “My children would grow up without feeling the warmth of their father and I am tired of this endless trial. “I really do not know what I have done to be treated this way. “Is it not better to die than to wait and be messed up this way?” Okah asked. Immediately after Okah ended his speech, he grabbed a chair in the court and quickly moved toward a window on third floor of the five-storey building and attempted to jump down. He was immediately pulled back by security operatives, lawyers and other litigants from embarking on the action. Consequently, Kolawole adjourned the case to October 20 for continuation of trial. Others charged in the case are Obi Nwabueze and Edmund Ebuware. The fourth accused, Tiemkemfa Osuvwo, died in Kuje prison, while Ebuwari has been jailed for life as his case was separately decided. However, Okah and Nwabueze have been facing long trial as a result of the introduction of numerous injunctions from both the prosecution and defence teams. (NAN)
