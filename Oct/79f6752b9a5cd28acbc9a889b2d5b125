It was a dramatic session at the Senate on Thursday before the confirmation of the nomination of former governor of Rivers State, Chibuike Amaechi. The PDP senators opposed his confirmation as minister in a debate that nearly snowballed into a rowdy session. However, after the walk-out bid of PDP senators, the APC senators, who were in the majority, confirmed the nomination of 18 ministerial nominees including Amaechi. Those confirmed on Thursday included Adebayo Shittu, Kadjiat Abba Ibrahim, Heineken Lokpobiri, Claidius Omoyele Daramola, Baba Shehuri Mustapha, James Ocholi, Isaac Folorunsho Adewole, Bawa Bwari, Geoffrey Onyeama and Zainab Ahmed. Others are Masur Mohammed Danladi, Usani Uguru, Okechukwu Elemanah, Anthony Anwuka, Mohammed Musa Bello, Adamu Adamu and Aisha Abubakar. The senate had earlier dissolved into a closed-door session to discuss the issue of confirmation of Amaechi.
