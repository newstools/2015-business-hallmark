Twenty-three persons were killed and 295 houses destroyed during the September 15 invasion of Kadunung village in Mangu local Government Area of Plateau by gunmen. Mr John Tamba, the Secretary of Mangu Local Government Council, made the disclosure in an interview in Mangu. Tamba said 852 internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Kadunang were being camped in three camps in Mangu. He said 353 of them were children under five years and 36 pregnant women, and that the 852 IDPs were camped at Boto, Bwalbwang and Doss camps, all in Gindiri District of Mangu. He said the committee that was set up by the council to assess the damage caused by the invasion also discovered that five vehicles and 10 motorcycles were burnt during the attack. According to the secretary, the attack has put the council in “a precarious situation because we do not know how to cater for the IDPs’’. “The council embarked on this assessment to know the level of damage done to Kadunung people and how the federal, state and local governments could assist the victims. “We are appealing to the victims to remain calm as government is doing all it can to alleviate their suffering as well as rehabilitate them, ’’ he said. Tamba said at the initially stage of the crisis, the council provided relief materials worth over N2 million to the victims. He said that the council in conjunction with SEMA and NEMA were gathering relief materials to present to the victims toward rehabilitating them. “We will ensure that every household benefits from any assistance that may come, no matter how small, ’’he said. He called on the people to remain calm and be vigilant against any form of attack. (NAN)
