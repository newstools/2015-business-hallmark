Governor Ayo Fayose of Ekiti State on Thursday cancelled all forms of fanfare as well as stadium parades usually held on Independence Day celebrations.
Fayose in a broadcast said there was nothing to celebrate in view of the economic situation in the country.
“I do not think it is proper to engage in jamboree when it is almost becoming increasingly difficult to pay workers’ salaries.
“The current situation demands sober reflection from all and we cannot pretend about this,” Fayose said.
He ordered residents to stay at home and enjoy the celebration in low-key.
As a result of the governor’s order, the usual activities associated with the celebration were absent in most parts of Ado-Ekiti on Thursday.
However, there were few places where pockets of activities were organised by individuals or corporate bodies. (NAN)
