YINKA LAWAL The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has assured that it would continue to reward deserving, to make life more meaningful to them after retirement.  The Head of National Office of the council, Dr Charles Eguridu, gave the assurance in Lagos while speaking on the sidelines of a send-off party for seven retiring deputy registrars of the council.  Eguridu described the retiring officers as vital to the council’s operations. He said that having played their roles well, it was also the responsibility of the council to ensure that they were well celebrated even after retirement. “It has been the tradition of WAEC to celebrate deserving officers, who retire from the service of the council. “We are just doing what we are familiar with and we shall continue to do it to ensure that they enjoy life after retirement.  “These officers have served the council over the years and having retired, we felt we must do the usual by celebrating them in line with our tradition,” Eguridu said.  The officer advised his retiring officers not to shut down on life, saying that they should see life outside the council as another page that God had opened for them. He told the retirees to look at how best they could serve humanity, not necessarily for monetary gains but to make the world a better place to live in.  One of the retirees, Mr Kester Ekekwe, lauded the council for the elaborate send-off, saying that the tradition should not be discontinued. Ekekwe said that he was elated to be celebrated, having served the council meritoriously. He said that he would continue to pray for the council to keep its standards high and to grow from strength to strength.
