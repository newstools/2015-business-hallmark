A 65-year-old woman, Mrs Agnes Elue of 293B Agbani Road, Enugu, has been murdered in cold blood allegedly by her male house help. A statement from the police spokesman in Enugu, Mr Ebere Amaraizu, on Wednesday said the deceased was hacked down with a pestle. It stated that the incident happened when the deceased requested for the proper accounts of the sales made by the suspect, Joseph Ijeh, in her shop. “The deceased, a proprietress of a bar, was allegedly killed by her manservant. “The suspect escaped, leaving the dead body inside one of the rooms for some days before it was discovered and reported to police operatives,” it said. It stated that the suspect upon his arrest confessed to the crime. “The suspect revealed that the request for him to render account by his mistress angered him. “While the woman was waiting in the sitting room for the account to be rendered, the suspect hit her with pestle which caused her death,” it stated.
