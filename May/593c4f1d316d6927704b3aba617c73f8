The officers include the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Bashir Okesina, the Registrar, Dr. Julius Faniran and the Bursar, Alhaji Fatai Lasisi. This was contained in the letter of termination of appointment given to the affected officers, a copy of which was shown to journalists by the Academic Staff Union of the University on Wednesday. The Governing Council of the University took the step, following the recommendation of the Visitation Panel set up by the State Governor, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola to look at the crisis in the institution. The panel had probed the allegations of financial misappropriation and
mismanagement in the university and recommended the sack of the principal officers. However in its reaction to this development, the Academic Staff Union of
Universities (ASUU) has kicked against the decision, saying it violates the principle of equity and fairness. In a statement by its Chairman, Dr. Abiona Oluseye the union said the action was done in bad faith, adding, “It is instructive to state that a visitation panel was constituted by the governor and the report submitted. ASUU-Uniosun is of the opinion that it would have been better for the council to wait for the White Paper on the report to be released by the governor before assuming the position of a judge. Against the backdrop of the on-going, ASUU-Uniosun hereby calls for the immediate reversal of the decision, pending the outcome of the
White Paper on the matter.”
