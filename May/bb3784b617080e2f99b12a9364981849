 The Senator-elect to represent Ogun East Senatorial District of Ogun State, Buruji Kashamu, has alleged that former President Olusegun Obasanjo is head of his political opponent in the country. He stated that his political activities have brought him some powerful enemies including his former president. Kashamu alleged further that Obasanjo and himself were political allies between 2009 and 2012, when he worked for him and his candidate for governorship of Ogun State, General Olurin. He said they, however, fell out because of Obasanjo’s stand for internal democracy in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Consequently, himself and his allies resorted to litigation to loosen Obasanjo’s hold on the party. Kashamu who alleged that Obasanjo is scheming to kidnap him, filed a suit at a Federal High Court in Lagos seeking nine declarative orders from the court among which are: an order restraining the defendants and their agents from arresting, detaining, or otherwise effecting his abduction upon spurious allegation: An order directing the clerk of the National Assembly to accord him every facility and privileges due to him as a senator-elect of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; a declaration that arrangements being made by the defendants in collusion with United State of America security operatives in west Africa and his political opponents led General Olusegun Obasanjo to abduct him and forcibly transport him to United States of America on the basis of allegations which have been the subject of investigation by Interpol and litigation in competent court in United Kingdom and which he has been exonerated are illegal, unlawfuL, ultra vires and constitute breach of his fundamental right to freedom of movement as enshrined in Section 41 of constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999.
