Some capital market operators have expressed fears that the ongoing national energy crisis if not checked would paralyse activities at the Nigerian capital market.    They said on Tuesday in Lagos that the energy crisis had already affected the level of activities in the nation’s bourse.    President, Association of Stockbroking Houses of Nigeria (ASHON), Mr Emeka Madubuike, lamented that the level of activities in the market had dropped drastically because of the energy crisis.    Madubuike said the stalemate had grounded the economy to halt, adding that the capital market was passing through hard times. “We are hoping that there will be clear vision of things by next week with the new government,” Madubuike said.    He called on the incoming government to ensure prompt settlement of all issues affecting economic growth and development.  Dr David Ogogo, Registrar/Chief Executive Officer, Institute of Capital Market Registrars (ICMR), said that many companies would likely close shop if the energy crisis lingered.    Ogogo said that companies had no choice than to close operations to avoid incurring unnecessary overheads.  He said the impact on the market would be negative if quoted companies declared losses due to the ongoing energy crisis that would increase cost of operations. “We are praying for positive development and hoping that the whole thing is sorted out before the week runs out, if it continues this way, it will affect the market adversely,” Ogogo said.    Mazi Okechukwu Unegbu, the former President, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), described the development as disturbing.  Unegbu said that volume of transactions in the market would reduce as many investors would find it difficult to place their orders due to the current energy crisis in the country.    He said the market was going through tough times due to different dislocations in the economy.    Also speaking, Mr Sehinde Adenagbe, the Managing Director, Standard Union Securities Ltd., said the development would drag down investment and confidence in the market.  Adenagbe said that Nigerians were groaning under the present situation and called for removal of fuel subsidy.    He said that fuel subsidy should be removed for Nigerians to know the reality of the situation on ground.
