The Lagos State Government has cancelled restriction on Human/Vehicular movement during the May statewide monthly sanitation exercise coming up this Saturday as part of preparation for the inauguration/swearing-in ceremony of the new Governor and President. Tunji Bello, State Commissioner for the Environment, disclosed this recently saying that the cancellation is necessary in order to ensure hitch-free movement for the swearing-in/inauguration ceremony coming up both in Lagos and Abuja as well as allow normalcy return to our roads after the recent strike action by fuel marketers. While assuring that the June edition of the cleaning exercise will definitely hold next month, the Commissioner advised Lagosians to still use this period for the usual cleaning of their homes, drainages, frontage and environment. He stated further that LAWMA and other Waste Managers/PSP across the State will be ground to remove the waste generated during the cleaning exercise, stressing that with the gadual approach of peak rainy season in the State, Lagosians should dispose their waste through the PSP operators as well as avoid dumping waste into drains. According to him, “Lagosians should desist from patronizing Cart Pushers who end up disposing collected waste into canals which later results to flooding. But it must be emphasized that the State is also intensifying its mid-rain deflooding programme in order to reduce to minimum the incidence of flooding in the state”.
