  The lawmakers-elect for the Ekiti State House of Assembly have said they will not be rubber-stamping legislators for Governor Ayodele Fayose, whom they described as their mentor and leader. All the 26 lawmakers are members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and die-hard loyalists of the governor. Speaking at a press conference in Ado Ekiti, the lawmaker-elect for Moba Constituency 1, Kola Oluwawole, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues, assured the people that matters brought before them by Fayose would be subjected to thorough debate, in the interest of the people. He added that the next assembly would protect the principles of separation of powers, in spite of belonging to the same party with the governor. “The next assembly won’t be rubberstamp. We are going to give the people robust legislation through thorough and dispassionate debate of issues brought before us. “We can disagree with the governor, if that will make Ekiti better, but that will not truncate our relationship as brothers and sisters. We will do exactly what the constitution empowers us to do, which is to serve as checks and balances to the executive. “The Lagos and Osun Assemblies in the Southwest were populated by members of APC, does that make them rubberstamp? So, it will be wrong for people to think we are going to be rubberstamp because we are Fayose’s loyalists.” On the impeachment crisis rocking the assembly, the lawmakers-in-waiting claimed that they had reached out to Speaker Adewale Omirin on the need to tread the path of honour, but said the overtures were rebuffed. “Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo State inherited a PDP-dominated Assembly from Prof Osunbor, but he was not driven out of town because of this. Omirin and other APC lawmakers should forget about personal ambitions and give the needed cooperation to the governor.
