 The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has released its economic report for February 2015, showing that growth in the key monetary aggregate decelerated further. The report which was released yesterday stated that broad money (M2) declined by 1.6 per cent, compared with the 0.1 per cent decline recorded in January. The apex bank explained that the development relative to the level at the end of the preceding month was due, to the 6.4 and 4.3 per cent fall in foreign assets (net) and other assets (net) of the banking system, respectively. According to the report, narrow money supply (M1) slipped by 5.1 per cent, compared with the level at the end of the preceding month, due to the 6.6 and 4.7 per cent decline in its currency and demand deposit components, respectively. “Over the level at end-December 2014, (M2), broad money supply fell by 1.70 per cent. Reserve money (RM) rose by 4.1 per cent from its level in the preceding month. “Available data indicated that interest rates generally rose during the review month. All other deposit rates of various maturities rose from a range of 3.57 – 10.79 per cent,” it said. The economic report stated that in February, the average prime lending and maximum lending rates went northward.

The weighted average inter-bank call rate rose to 12.90 per cent above 7.49 per cent in the preceding month, reflecting the liquidity condition in the inter-bank funds market,” the report further declared. There was a 1.1 per cent increment in total value of money market assets outstanding in February 2015, which stood at N7,868.2 billion, compared with the increase of 1.5 per cent at the end of the preceding month.
