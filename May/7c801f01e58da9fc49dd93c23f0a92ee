Chief Olu Adebanjo, one of the leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State and former Minister of Information in the Second Republic regime of President Shehu Shagari, is dead. Adebanjo died at his residence in Idowa, in Odogbolu Local Government Area of Ogun State on Thursday at about 1.35pm at the age of 83. While commiserating with the family at the late statesman residence, Gov. Ibikunle Amosun described Adebanjo as a selfless leader and a pillar, which the progressive party was built on. The governor said Adebanjo left a great legacy of a true progressive behind by contributing to the growth of the state and the country. Amosun also said he was happy that Adebanjo’s dream of having a progressive man rule the country came to pass before his demise with the victory of President-elect, Muhammadu Buhari. The governor promised the late Adebanjo’s widow, Joanna, that the state would ensure Adebanjo got a befitting burial worthy of a statesman. Also, Ogun State Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Mr Bimbo Ashiru and Ogun APC stalwart, Chief Doja Adewolu, described Adebanjo as a great man who spent most of his life in meritorious service. Hon. Akintunde Amu, a family member, said Adebanjo had been ill since February. He thanked the governor and his entourage for a swift response to the news of Adebanjo’s demise. The family had yet to fix a date for the burial of the deceased.
