A total of 11,449 Nigerians have returned from the Republic of Niger, the National Emergency Management Agency has said. NEMA said the returnees were registered at the transit camp in Geidam, Yobe State, adding that about 7,000 of them had been transported to their respectively communities. Although the agency did not tell why the returnees left Nigeria, our correspondent gathered that the disastrous activities of insurgents in the Northern region may have forced the citizens to escape from the states. The Director-General of the agency, Mr. Sani Sidi, said more returnees would be transported from the transit camp to their communities in the coming days. The agency, in a statement said it “has so far registered a total of 11,449 Nigerian returnees from the Republic of Niger at the transit camp in Geidam, Yobe State and transported about 7,000 of them to their various states as at today Tuesday May 12, 2015.” It noted that transportation of the returnees would continue as more high capacity buses and vehicles had been engaged to fully transport them to their various states. “The agency is also continuing with the provision of basic supports at the transit camp,” it added. NEMA’s DG, according to the statement, said the agency was fully committed to the transportation of the returnees to their states and affirmed that its staff would remain at the transit camp until the last person leaves. He said more relief support had also been provided to take care of them at the camp. “From the registration, the returnees are identified to be Nigerians from Borno, Taraba, Jigawa, Kano, Benue, Bauchi, Sokoto, Niger, Kebbi, Zamfara, Katsina, Yobe, Gombe, Adamawa, Nasarawa, Imo, and Delta states,” the statement added.
