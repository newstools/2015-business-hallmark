French oil services company Bourbon said on Monday that the three Nigerian crew members kidnapped after one of its speedboats was boarded off the Nigerian coast on April 8 had been released. “They are in good health and arrived at Port Harcourt on May 8,” Bourbon said in a brief statement. The crew members had been abducted on board a Surfer 1440 boat. Bourbon operates a fleet of light, fast cruisers called Surfers that are used to move professionals to offshore oil and gas sites, especially in West Africa
