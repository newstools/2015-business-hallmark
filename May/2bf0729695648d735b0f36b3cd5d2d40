 The All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied a published report that its National Working Committee (NWC) met on Monday night and decided to zone the Senate Presidency to the North-Central and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to the South-West, saying nothing like that ever happened. In a statement issued in Abuja on Tuesday by its National Secretary, Hon. Mai Mala Buni, the party said it was deeply embarrassed by the story, which was apparently planted in the media to sow the seeds of instability in the party. ”The NWC never discussed the issued of zoning at its meeting. Therefore, the report of its decision on zoning is a figment of the imagination of whoever concocted the story,” it said. APC said nothing has changed since the President-elect said he is ready to work with anyone from any part of the country who occupies any of the principal offices of the incoming National Assembly, including those of the Senate Presidency and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
