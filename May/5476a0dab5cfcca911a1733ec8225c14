Thirty-three members-elect of the House of Representatives for the incoming 8th Assembly from the North-east have endorsed Mohammed Tahir Monguno for the position of speaker. In a meeting held in Abuja at the weekend, the 33 Reps-elect said they were satisfied with Monguno’s candidature as someone from the North-east zone whom they believed has the capacity to occupy the seat.
Addressing journalists at the end of the meeting, Rep Goni Bukar (APC, Yobe) said they reached the decision based on their conviction that Monguno, as a third term member and a former Secretary to the Borno State Government, has all it takes to take the House to the next level.
Goni, who also announced his withdrawal from the race for Monguno, noted however that should the All Progressives Congress (APC) zone the speaker to the South-west and deputy speaker to North-east, they would support Gbajabiamila and push for Monguno to go for the deputy speaker’s seat.
He said in the event that the party zones the seat to the South-west, “we cannot look for any leader, because even before we took over the government he (Gbajabiamila) was our leader, and today we’re in the position.”
The 33 Reps that endorsed Monguno include  Sadiq Ibrahim, Yusuf Buba, Abdulraman Shaibu and Philip Gutuwa, all from Adamawa State.
Others are Muhammed Sani Abdu, Lawal Yahayah, Tata Omar, Isa Hassan Mohammed, Ibrahim Baba, Mohammed Gololo, Salisu Ningi, Musa Aliyu, Ahmed Yarima and Adamu Gupai from Bauchi State.
From Borno State, those that endorsed Monguno are Mohammed Nur Sheriff, Mahmud Lawan, Mohammed Sanda, Dr Asabe Bashir, Malam Bukar Gana, Abdulkadir Rahis, Ayuba Mohammed Bello and Jibrin Satumari.
Those from Gombe State are Khamisu Ahmed Mailantarki, Binta Bello, Ustaz Yunus, Umar Barambu and Ali Isa JC, while Yobe State has Goni Bukar Lawan, Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, Ismaila Gadaka, Ya’u Galadima, Sidi Yakubu and Sabo G  Culled from Daily Trust
