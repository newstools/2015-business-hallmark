 While accepting the trust of world football has to be regained, FIFA President Sepp Blatter has responded to the arrest of top officials from the sport’s governing body by insisting it showed his efforts to eradicate corruption were working. The deepest crisis in FIFA’s 111-year history is threatening Blatter’s bid to win a fifth, four-year term in a contest against Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan on Friday, with European football leaders trying to delay the election. “As unfortunate as these events are, it should be clear that we welcome the actions and the investigations by the US and Swiss authorities and believe that it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football,” Blatter said on Wednesday. “Let me be clear: Such misconduct has no place in football and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game. “We will continue to work with the relevant authorities and we will work vigorously within FIFA … to regain your trust.”
