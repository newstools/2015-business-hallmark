 The All Progressives Congress (APC) Unity Forum has stated that the party’s senator-elect are yet to elect a Senate President, contrary to reports in the media and on social media. The Unity Forum comprising of senators from the North East, North Central, North West and South West reached a resolution to support Senator Lawan Ahmad and Senator George Akume ticket for the Senate President and Deputy Senate President respectively. In a statement issued yesterday and signed by Senator Robert Ajayi (South West); Senator Bukar Abba Ibrahim (North East); Senator Barnabas Gemade (North Central) and Senator Abu Ibrahim (North West) it said: “Given the conflicting media accounts surrounding the issue of the prospective candidate for the Senate presidency from the APC, we of the Unity Forum are constrained to make this clarification. “This response has become necessary because we do not want to portray our party as a collection of desperate, indiscipline and selfish people. Rather, we believe that party preservation and the overall interest of the party should be paramount at this point. “For the records, there was no time before the retreat, during the retreat or after the retreat where and when the issue of a primary election to pick the Senate President was tabled or agreed upon.”
