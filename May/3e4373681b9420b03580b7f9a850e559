Patience Egbeni and Kate Eni, two cousins of President Goodluck Jonathan, have been abducted by gunmen at Akimpelai, Ogbia local government area of Bayelsa State. The Nation gathered that the unidentified gunmen, numbering six, stormed the community riverbank at about 8.30am on Tuesday and seized the women. The women were reportedly abducted from their provision stores located along the riverbank. A source, who spoke in confidence, said the hoodlums forced their victims into a waiting speedboat and took them to an unknown place. The incident, which occurred few days to a grand reception being organized for President Jonathan on May 29, was said to have devastated the President’s kinsmen. The source said: “The victims are two maternal cousins of the President. We know that they have been preparing to welcome the President after the May 29 handover. Unless they are rescued before then, their dream of welcoming their brother will be a mirage.” When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Butswat Asinim, said the gunmen were dressed in military camouflage. Asinim, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), said one of the victims, Egbeni, is 35 years old. “The gunmen were dressed in military camouflage. They went to the provision stores of the victims at the riverside and abducted them into a waiting speedboat,” he said. He said the marine and anti-kidnapping squad of the police, including the Joint Task Force (JTF), Operation Pulo Shield, had been contacted.  Culled from Guardian
