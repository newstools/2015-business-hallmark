 Nigeria’s senior women’s team lost 3-2 to City Strikers in a friendly at the Mainbowl of the Abuja National Stadium on Wednesday. The test game wrapped up the Super Falcons’ preparations for Saturday’s Olympic Games Qualifiers against Mali at the same venue. Ngozi Okobi and Iniabasi Umotong scored for the seven-time African Women’s Champions. After both sides had battled for supremacy, Falcons went in front in the 25th minute. Halimat Ayinde took a long range shot which was blocked but Okobi latched on the rebound to score. The City Strikers equalized on the half-hour mark when a shot from the eighteen yard box beat ageless goalkeeper Precious Dede. They continued to mount pressure and got two more goals in the 55th and 72nd minute. In-form Porthsmouth Ladies forward Iniabasi grabbed a last-gasp strike as the match ended 3-2 in favour of City Strikers.
