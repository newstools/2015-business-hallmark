 Managing Director, Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Mr Ibrahim Abdulsalam, has said that the agency was working on new modalities to recover debts owed by local airlines. In a chat with aviation correspondents in Lagos, Abdulsalam said international carriers operating in Nigeria had been up to date in paying their charges to the agency. He said that if the debt owed by the local carriers was not properly addressed it would lead to the grounding of services offered by NAMA and other agencies in the aviation industry. “We should work out modalities for payment of debts owed by the airlines. That is why we are not releasing the figure they owe us. “It is our local airlines that have been defaulting in payment; they are part of our system and we have to be moderate with them. “Nobody goes to fly on credit; you have to pay for the ticket. If we ground the airlines, people will be affected,” he said. He said that the agency had been discussing with a consultant of Arik Airline on the debt owed by the carrier.
