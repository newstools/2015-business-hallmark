Kabiru, the first son of Osun State Governor, Rauf Aregbesola, has asked a national daily (not Daily Times) to re-publish the apology written to retract a story alleging that he was arrested for money-laundering at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos.‎ The national daily on Friday, May 15, 2015 carried a story titled “Controversy Trails Aregbesola Son’s Alleged Arrest. Kabiru, while rejecting the apology through his counsel, Bashiru Ajibola, said the apology was not directed to him. Through the publication, Kabiru alleged that his reputation has been injured and reduced in the eye of the public as a money-launderer. He, therefore, demanded that new apology should be published in two national newspapers within seven days. Kabiru’s counsel also complained that the circulation of the apology was limited to the tabloid without the on-line portal. The statement read, “We are not unaware of the belated half-hearted apology in your Vanguard edition of Saturday 16th May, 2015 in an obscure location. The said apology fell short of the remedy for the damage which your publication had caused our client.” Also, the Osun State Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Ganiyu Olaoluwa has been asked to retract and tender unreserved apology within seven days. The counsel added: “It may also interest you to know that our client has never been arrested anywhere in the country or outside the country for any offence since he was born. Our client is a young professional with a brilliant career. However, your orchestrated lie had reduced the image of our client in the estimation of every right thinking member of the public. “It has also injured our client’s reputation and that of members of his families as you have portrayed him falsely as a money launder.”  Culled from Daily Times
