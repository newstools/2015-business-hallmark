President Goodluck Jonathan has said that he expects to be persecuted by the incoming administration of President-elect,Muhammadu Buhari. Jonathan also warned his aides and ministers to be prepared for persecution as well. The President made the comments on Sunday, May 10, 2015, during a thanksgiving service organized in his honour at the Anglican Church in the Life Camp area of Abuja. “…For ministers and aides who served with me, I sympathize with them, they will be persecuted. And they must be ready for that persecution. To my ministers, I wish you what I wish myself. They will have hard times, we will all have hard times. Our ways will be rough,” Jonathan said. The President also said that some decisions he made during his administration prevented him from being re-elected. “Some hard decisions have their own cost, no doubt about that. That I have run the government this way that stabilized certain things, the electoral process and other things that brought stability into this country. They were very costly decisions which I myself must be ready to pay for,” he said. “Some people come to me and say this or that person, is he not your friend that benefited. Is it not your government that this person benefited from? But this is what the person is saying? But I used to say worse statements will come. If you take certain decisions, you should know that those close to you will even abandon you at some point. And I tell them that more of my so-called friends will disappear,” he added. Jonathan thanked Nigerians for their support and urged citizens and groups to pray for the success of Buhari’s administration. The President will handover to Buhari on May 29, 2015.
