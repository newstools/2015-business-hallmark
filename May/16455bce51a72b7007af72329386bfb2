Kunle Awosiyan The worsening fuel scarcity has thrown Nigerians into serious hardship as cost of living has increased beyond the reach of ordinary people. A litre a fuel now sells between N300 and N500 at black markets as against the original pump price of N87 in some parts of the country, Lagos and Ogun States in precise. Nigerians battle hard to get fuel, following the strike action embarked upon by oil workers, about four days ago. At present, the cost of transportation had increased by over 200 per cent. Investigation revealed that transport fare between Abule Egba and Oshodi now stood at N400 instead of N100 as at this morning. Hallmark news also gathered that commuters now paid N500 to travel from Obalende to Ikeja while Berger to Ketu now cost about N300 to transit. In the aviation industry, passengers were found stranded at the airports because some of the airlines did not have aviation fuel to run the business. Some factories had shut down temporarily due to lack of diesel while the costs of food items rose rapidly due to the high cost of transportation. Speaking to Hallmark News, a stranded commuter who simply identified herself as Bimpe described the situation as too bad, adding that she could not afford the cost of transportation from Berger, Lagos to Ibadan at the rate of N1, 500. She said, “I have been waiting at the Bus Stop for more than one hour, yet I cannot get a bus. The normal cost is N500 but this morning it has been jacked up to N1500.” A Lagos resident, Mr. Paul Ogbonna told Hallmark News how he had been groaning under the present situation, saying that he now spent N2000 extra to put food on his table. “My wife spends N300 to grind pepper instead of N100. She spends N500 extra on transport to the market. It is a big problem now and I think the government must do something before it gets out of hands,” he stated.
