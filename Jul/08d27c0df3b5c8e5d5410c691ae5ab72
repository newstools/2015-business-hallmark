LUKMAN OLOGUNRO Not ready to be on the headlines for perhaps a negative reason as it is in the cases of coach Stephen Keshi and goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama, Super Eagles’ midfielder, Ogenyi Onazi has formally apologized to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for his poor misconduct that led to his dismissal in last month’s 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match against Chad in Kaduna.
The SS Lazio of Italy player  in a letter dated 30th June, 2015 which was addressed to the NFF secretary general wrote: “Sequel to your letter REF: NFF/OGS/Admin/Vol.V/009, I hereby tender an unreserved apology with respect to my conduct which led to my dismissal in the game against Chad in Kaduna.
“I accept the fact that my act was tantamount to an unacceptable one on the field of play. However, I want to inform you that my action on the pitch was not premeditated and was only a reaction to a violent attack on me by the Chadian player, who hit me from behind while I was standing outside the penalty box.
“In addition, I had tendered an unreserved apology immediately after the match via my official social media accounts, as well as in the traditional media, to my teammates and to Nigerians who felt let down by an act they considered surprising because of my reputation in that regard.
“Also, I had volunteered to attend the two matches that I have since been punished for by CAF both at home and away, to support my teammates. I believe this is an amenable punishment and therefore appeal for the further fine of $5,000 that was imposed on me by the NFF.”
Keshi and Enyeama are under NFF scrutiny with the former accused of applying for a job while under contract while the latter is being accused of insubordination.
