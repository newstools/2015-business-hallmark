An official in the Anambra State sports ministry, who pleaded anonymity, said that even though the trip was approved, but that they could not secure the funds for the trip. Some of the athletes, who told  newsmen expressed disappointment at their inability to make the trip after they had intensively prepared for the event..Anambra hosted the last AFN Golden league at the Rojenny Stadium between June 10 and June 11, at which a new 8-lane tartan tracks were unveiled by the state.They said they had gathered at the ministry youths and sports early on Friday in anticipation of their departure for Abuja but were stranded before dispersing .Emmanuel Okeke, a shot put thrower, who said he was invited from Lagos by Johnny Igboka, the Chief Coach to come and compete for Anambra, regretted losing time and money.Okeke said he had a personal best of 17 metres at the Lagos All-Comers, but did not receive training support to improve on his performance.“It is shame that Anambra did not make to Abuja golden league, just two weeks after hosting the event, there is no reason why we should not have attended.“We have been sponsoring ourselves in the past but thought  that now that we have hosted, the government will encourage us to attend this one,” he said. Ifunanya Muoghalu, a female quarter-miler said they had once again been denied the opportunity to fight for places in the national athletics team to major events.“We were told to prepare for this championship and after spending the entire day without anyone to talk to us, we decided to go back to our various homes.“Our problem is not just  lack of competitions,  but welfare, they did not give us allowances and encouragement’’.Muoghalu said she won a gold and three bronze medals for the state at the schools’ sports festival in Otukpo last November and had yet to be rewarded. A high jumper, Chizoba Awoke said he was disappointed at the loss opportunity to feature at the Abuja meet, saying it was a bad build up for the National Sports Festival to be staged sometime in Calabar.Awoke, who was a joint fourth place finisher in the Anambra Golden league, having scaled two metres, said he felt bad because he would have scored more points in Abuja to earn a place in the AFN team.“I am disappointed at what happened; we just missed our chances of progressing and that is why more athletes are leaving to compete for other states,” he said. Tony Nnacheta, the Anambra Commissioner for Sports told newsmen that he had approved the funds and other logistics for the team to travel to Abuja.“I am surprised to be informed that the directives were not effected. I duly approved the movement of athletes and crew’’He said.
