BY AUSTIN FAIR NWAULU Looks like former head of state and later president, Chief OlusegunObasanjo, will never cease to entertain all and sundry with his jibes not minding the person at the receiving end. After taking our own dear immediate past President, GentlemnnGoodluck Jonathan to the cleaners, severally in recent times, it is now the turn of the Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka. Trust the General who hardly cares a hoot over whose ox is gored, all he claim’s that all he knows about the bearded Prof is that ”if I want somebody to give me the best wine, one of the people I will go to is Wole Soyinka and I know he will have a taste for good wine…” Chief Obasanjo was guest of Channels ”Book Club” on Sunday where he spoke about his new book ”My Watch”. He said that what he wrote about the Kongi in the book was purely his view. ”Soyinka is a gifted man but he is a bad politician and I have always said that and he is surely a better wine connoisseur…” Only God knows what will follow next!
