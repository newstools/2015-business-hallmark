  *‘There is a difference between me and my son’  Former Sultan of Sokoto, Ibrahim Dasuki, has expressed disgust over the raid of his residence by the State Security Service (SSS) in connection with allegations against Sambo, his son and former National Security Adviser (NSA). Operatives of the secret police stormed the homes of the Dasukis in Sokoto and Abuja, last week, a development that the younger Dasuki had earlier condemned. Speaking to BBC Hausa service on Monday, the former sultan said the SSS should have sought his permission before entering his house. “The security forces should not have entered my house without seeking authority, because there is a difference between me and my son,” he said. He was deposed by the regime of Sani Abacha in 1996. Narrating his experience in an interview last week, the former security adviser said his father was receiving medical attention in the United Kingdom when the incident happened. Dasuki added that he was being witch-hunted, saying he did not deserve such from the All Progressives Congress (APC) based on his fairness to all concerned parties, including the then opposition party, in the lead-up to the 2015 general election. “I was fair to all as NSA. Even when I had security cause to act on some issues, inflammatory comments and actions against the government of the day by those in the opposition, I exercised restraint… I gave my best for this transition, which led to the victory of the opposition over the ruling party,” he had said. “They went to my father’s house including breaking into the ceiling to look for incriminating documents. They broke a safe in my father’s house. Also, my sister kept a 20-year old box in my father’s house, they also forced it open. What has my father got to do with this? And the old man is in hospital in London. He was shocked to hear that they broke into his house.”
