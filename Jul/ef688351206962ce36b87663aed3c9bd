A chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief OgbonnayaOnu, onMonday called on Igbo to support President MuhammaduBuhari administration. Onu made the call in Abuja when he received the planning committee for theupcoming World Igbo Conference. According to him, the Buhari administration is committed to ensuring that anew Nigeria emerges and flourishes, so that the Igbo, who live everywhere,will be major beneficiaries. He told OhanezeNdigbo to ensure that Igbo embraced the APC and supportBuhari’s administration as they are for all. According to him, the victory of APC at the polls was made possible becauseIgbo in the 19 states overwhelmingly supported the party during theelections. “Ohaneze must be commended for what it is doing as regards the welfare ofNdigbo throughout the country and beyond. We have Igbo everywhere. There isno town in Nigeria where there is no Igboman. “In Nigeria and across the world, there is no place where we don’t haveIgbos resident, and the Igbos occupy a very important position in Nigeria. “We as Igbo are the only major ethnic group that is not indigenous to anyother country in the world. What that means is that outside Nigeria, thereis no other country for the Igbo. For other major ethnic groups this is notthe case’’, Onu said. Earlier, Chief Ben Aranusi, Chairman of the interim planning committee,said it was ready to fight for the right of Ndigbo to make them becomerelevant in all spheres as before. “In the sixties, Igbo were leaders in academia, commerce, the military andin politics but now we are not only crying about marginalisation, but arenow like internally displaced race. “This Ohaneze caretaker is interested in the welfare of the Igbo man andthat is why we are here to inform you about this conference. “The Igbo race cannot continue like this. This body is ready to fight forthe right of any Igbo man at any level. The Igbo must be ready from 2019 to2023. “We have a new administration and we are looking at 2019. Where are we inNigeria politics, academia, and commerce? “Igbo man seems to be nowhere, we must chart a course and have adirection”, he said.
