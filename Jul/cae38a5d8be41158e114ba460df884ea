 America, their America – Nigerians react It is no longer news but it s trending and remains the hottest all around the world. The death, last Sunday of irrepressible singer, Whitney Houston’s daughter, Bobbi Kristina still sends cold shivers down the spines of many. It is even more pathetic and touching when one remembers that it was just three years ago that her dear mother, Whitney, gave up the ghost in a similar circumstance. Like her mother, Bobbi just 22, was found in a bathtub in January this year by her boyfriend, Nick Gordon. And after months of struggles, she succumbed to the apron strings of the monster called death. Six months in coma is mysterious to say the least. And that is why the conclusion is unanimous – that her death was drug-related. For now, according to the report of an initial autopsy on her, there is no evidence of wrongdoing from other sources. It is not strange for mother and daughter to be bound together. Whitney shared a lot of things in common with Bobbi. They also wowed their audiences severally on stage. The song ‘’My Love is Your Love’’ which still resonates is a test case. Although investigations are still ongoing to unearth the actual cause of her death, Nick Gordon, the boy friend has confessed that both of  them ‘’had been doing drugs and she took much.’’ Back home, a cross section of Nigerians said that they received the sad news with mixed feelings. ‘’America is too free and exposed to a lot of vices. I don’t envy them and can only go there on a visit or business, not to reside. It is their America with a culture so crude and debasing,’’ Tony Utonna, a showbiz player said. In the same vein, Grace Ndifreke, a student, regretted that America, a country that many hitherto see as a role model in many life’s ramifications, is gradually turning into a very unholy land. ‘’Suddenly, a lot of bizarre things happen there almost on daily basis. It is a shame.’’
