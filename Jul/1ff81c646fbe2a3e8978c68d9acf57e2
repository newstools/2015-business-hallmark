 Only a few people+ are aware that popular comedian and musicomedian, Julius Agwu, almost lost his life a few months back. The comic act who said he had a close shave with death narrated his ordeal. He also explained some unpleasant stories which emanated as a result of the tragedy. ”I can’t specifically state when and how it all started but could recollect that at some point he started losing weight drastically and many people were wondering what could be wrong,” a close associate volunteered. The ‘horse’ has however explained how it all began, “After  series of tests, two lumps were discovered in my brain! The lumps had been messing up my health and causing the incessant weight loss. “Immediately, the Caucasian surgeons went to work, operating on me for about 4 hours on Tuesday, May 12, 2015, at the Park Plaza Hospital in Houston Texas, United States of America,” he recalled. “It went on and on until sometime in May when I had a seizure at home while with my wife, Ibiere. She battled to halt that, after I ran out of breath. With the likely consequences starring her in the face, Ibiere got the maid and the security man to assist her in getting me into one of the cars. “And from there, they practically sprinted to the hospital in Lekki. Thank God the doctor was on call. He battled for hours with his team to bring me back to life,” Julius narrated. It was indeed a huge success and upon being discharged, Julius rested in the US for sometime before returning home recently.
