  Following the death of an unidentified man suspected to have died after consuming local gin in Orile area of Lagos, policemen from Orile Divisional Headquarters have begun to arrest sellers of local gin, otherwise known as ‘paraga‘, along the Alaba, Lagos-Badagry Expressway.  An eyewitness disclosed that the deceased who was said to have staggered home after leaving a local gin joint fell and hit his head on a pavement.  It was reported that the deceased made several attempts calling for help but unfortunately no one assisted him. It was gathered that local gin sellers in the area are now on the run for fear of being arrested or linking them to the tragedy.  It would be recalled that the Federal Government has declared the consumption of local gin illegal following the deaths of people said to have consumed it in Rivers and Ondo states recently.
