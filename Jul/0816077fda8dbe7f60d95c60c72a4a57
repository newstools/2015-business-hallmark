He is famously called as ‘Pastor Fire by his great worshippers. He was born into a polygamous background but never allowed that thought to deter his pursue it for quality education in his life. He was born by a Yoruba father and a Ghanaian mother but was given quality attention to the core. His spiritual contact with Dr. D. K Olukoya of MFM for few years also broadens his intellectual integrity in pursuit of the gospel of Christ. In this interview with Mindset Media Limited, he bares his mind on the need for young pastors to avoid the three Gs, girls, glory and gold and other issues in the Christian society. Excerpts:
Can we meet you sir?
I am Pastor Elisha Esho, the General Overseer of Prevailers International Christian Chapel. I am famously called as ‘Pastor Fire’ by my great worshippers of Jesus Christ. I attended my primary and secondary education here in Akoka and later proceeded to Osun State Polytechnic to study Mass Communication and Lagos State University for Public Relations and Advertising for my BSc.As a young man that is not contented with first degree and I later did my Masters’ degree in Centre for Leadership and Ministerial development at the Dunamis University and Doctoral degree in Theology in the same university which is affiliated with Oxford University, London Tell us about your calling into the ministry at this your youthful age.

Well, it is quiet interesting that many young men at my age are not ready to dedicate themselves to Jesus Christ. My parents sponsored my education to a certain level until I met Dr.D.k Olukoya of MFM whose lifestyle and ministry changed my mindset. I was born into a catholic home coupled with the fact my mother is a Ghanaian and my father is a typical Yoruba man but I was able to weather the storm of a polygamous background through fervent prayers and fasting. I was an active member of MFM for 4years where I wrote a book on ‘Ignite your Fire ‘while still LASU then and Dr.D.K Olukoya saw the book and fell in love with me to be at the youth department. I led several branches of MFM within Akoka, where I taught on school of membership class and Christian education. I knew that my calling was not in MFM but I dedicated myself to the things of God.Dr.D.K Olukoya paid some of my school fees and encouraged me to further my education in life. My book I wrote also helped me to pay some of my bills in school while my parents were not left out. Throughout my stay with Dr.D.K Olukoya I developed the culture of reading at least 4 to 5 books in a week and prayer fervently. I never left MFM in shame than Dr.D.K Olukoya calling his pastors to commission me for God’s assignment which has never happened while many pastors always break out. I led several retreats to the Prayer City of MFM, so my pedigree with Dr.Olukoya is cordial. I fasted for the same Mountain Dr.D.K Olukoya fasted for 40 days which I did 21 days for God to intervene in my calling. During my fasting in the mountian, God showed me abundant mercies in my life and family. Even the enemies came to tempt me in the mountain physically but I overcame them with the word of God. God has said, he will use me to set the captives free and that is what God is using us to do in this Akoka community where I grew up as a child. Man of God when you came into the church, I taught you were the secretary to the pastor of the church, but I was dumbfounded that you introduced yourself as the pastor, What gave you the courage to start a ministry at this youthful age while some of your equals are still depending on their parents? Thank you very much! God has commissioned me to start his work in His kingdom. I started with an NGO called Dreamer Builders International where I go from school to school to teach ethics, morals to our students and pupils. It would shock you that I got my wife from my school evangelism through the glorious power of God in me.Dr.D.K Olukoya training background also helped me too.Jesus Christ started his ministry at his younger age, so my own is not exceptional. It was not easy, I had some malicious allegations against me just to pull my ministry down even when I was not married but God saw me through. If God really calls you, He makes provisions for you in all ramifications. I knew the call of God was upon my life, so I never relented in doing what is right in His sight. What is your gift of calling?
God has called me into restoration of glory, deliverance, prophecy and healings. Tell us some of the challenges you are facing in ministry today.

My age never intimidated me among top pastors in Nigeria because God has mandated me to save souls for eternity. God has used me to liberate souls in Nigeria. My problem is that we have more shallow and small-minded pastors and members in the country who are not ready to learn like our great spiritual fathers, Dr.D.K Olukoya,Enoch Adeboye,Williams Kumuiyi and others. I refer to some of these pastors as cosmetic or chocolatetic intruders in the gospel of Christ. Most of them have watering messages that cannot hold the demons ransom. I believe that a church can grow without demonic influence and nothing more. Most of these things you see in my church today were given to me without notice. Book reading is one of the major challenges facing the Nigerian youth but only God will help us in this trying period. Tell us about your Tuesday Rain of Deliverance and Miracle service every week. God has been grateful to us. If you come here on Tuesday, It would amaze you how God is using us to set captives free with wonderful testimonies from worshippers. The fire of God is burning in our ministry. I have young pastors working along with me to propagate the good news of the lord.
Have you ever encountered any sexual embarrassment as a young handsome pastor? In fact, a lot but God continues to preserve me for this noble assignment. There is a trend in Nigeria that pastors are no longer trusted, what is your stake on it?

The truth of the matter is that, a lot of pastors have missed the track of God. Spiritual fathers are disappearing into the thin air while most young pastors are not ready to learn because everybody wants wealth at all cost. It is now difficult to access our great spiritual fathers while some want seed sowing relationship, especially the up and coming spiritual fathers. Three things that make some young pastors to fall are girls, glory and gold. If as a pastor you like these mundane things more than God, then your ministry is heading towards extinction. I have rejected some tithes from non-members of my church. I am not carried away by wealth but God has been making provisions for me.Today, I run a school and other things but my source of income comes outside the church. We have paid for members’ house rents, school fees and others. Your birthday bash is coming up soon and you are launching a book, tell us how the event would look like that day?

It is going to be great! I think, this is my 4th book or 5th, I believe in the power of reading and writing. I will invite crème da la crème in the society to grace the occasion. In five years to come, what should members expect from you as a Pastor?

Everything depends on God not me. Our church is looking on how to get its own land because we are on rented now. With the few years in ministry, God has done great things for us. Before then, I have featured on TV and radio programmes on the gospel of Jesus Christ. We shall do wonderful things before then.
