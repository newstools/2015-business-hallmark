LUKMAN OLOGUNRO | Former Super Eagles captain, Sunday Oliseh is reported to be in advanced talks with the Nigerian Football Federation to fill the vacant post of Super Eagles Head coach after the sacking of Stephen Keshi.
The former Junventus and Borrussia Dortmund midfielder tops the lists of favourites for the job as the NFF is believed to be looking for a Nigerian successor for Keshi.
Oliseh has little management experience, having coached only Belgian lower league side Vervietois between 2008 and 2009, but he does hold the Uefa Pro Licence but feelers point to him to be appointed in the coming days.
The 40-year-old Oliseh, who captained Nigeria to a silver medal outing at the 2000 Nations Cup jointly hosted by Ghana and Nigeria won 63 caps for Nigeria and was also part of the  country’s gold medal winning outing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, USA
Oliseh also played an integral role in Nigeria’s ending a Nations Cup drought in 1994 and also played at the World Cup in 1994 and 1998, helping the Super Eagles to the last-16 at both tournaments and in the latter he scored a memorable winner as Nigeria shocked Spain 3-2 in a group match.
A member of the most successful generation of Nigerian football stars, alongside Jay-Jay Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu, Emmanuel Amuneke, Daniel Amokachi and Finidi George, Oliseh has been working as a pundit, sport consultant and FIFA Technical Committee member.
He would take over from NFF technical director Shaibu Amodu and assistant coach Salisu Yusuf, who are are currently in charge on an interim basis.
