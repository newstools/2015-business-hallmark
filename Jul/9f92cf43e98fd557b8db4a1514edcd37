It is however important to find the right career, so that every day you wake up to do what you enjoy doing and not just what you do for money. Many people find themselves doing what they are not really called for every day of their lives. This has led some people to frustration. Some even complain of their employers, the nature of their job and even the time frame, they never get along at work. It is not impossible to find a career that soothes you, you can consider the following: What would you do if you were not paid? Alan Watts, a respected philosopher once said “What would you do if money were no object?” Find that thing you enjoy doing even without being paid, find that job that truly makes you happy, that thing you do relentlessly without getting bored. Take time to discover it,  that may be your ideal career. What am I good at? Ask yourself, what area do I really excel? Not just something that you get done but something where you do it better than most people that you meet? This is something that you should factor in when searching for a career. You may not think that you enjoy it too much, but the fact of the matter is that you often won’t get good at something unless you enjoy it, at least to a certain level. You may choose to call it your skill, overtime; you may be able to monetize this skill. What are my hobbies Ask yourself, what are my hobbies? The truth is that your hobbies can be monetized. This often means starting a small business and the headaches that come with it, but you may end up with a career that you really enjoy. Don’t ever think your hobby can never make good money for you. Research on your hobbies, talk to career experts, do some online reading, you will be amazed at what results you will come up with. What is my ideal dream job? Take whatever activity or job you discovered you are good at and break it down into its basic parts. Ask yourself what the job entails, what implications will it have on you? Will it in any way lead to personal fulfillment? These basic components make up what you should be looking for in a career. You can also think of your dream job. If someone walks into your room and promises to get you a job wherever you desire, what profession would you choose and what firm. What are the downsides to my career? Like they always say, there are two sides to a coin. When you consider a career, make sure to do your research so as to know both the positive and negative sides to it. Be well acquainted with what life looks like in that career path. You will need to know what the downsides of those jobs are if you want to make an informed decision. Can it meet my financial goals? If you are really in a job that gives you that sense of fulfillment and makes you happy, getting rich off of it may not really matter to you. However, life is full of obligations that go beyond just your sense of fulfillment or personal happiness, your job should be able to pay your bills.  If your dream career can’t help feed your family, pay your hospital bill or pay your fees, you may need to explore other options. However, you should always keep your focus on a job that provides that feeling of fulfillment and that will help you meet your financial obligations. Get a job If you really want to find a career, get one!  Apply for jobs within that area you consider your strength. You cannot know how deep a water is until you put your leg into it, you may not know if that career is for you until you get on board. You can’t just sit at home trying to figure out what career best soothes you. You really have to get started!
