The National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) and the National Leaders of the party have been urged to call Governor Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State to order for his penchant for abandoning his duty post. A non-governmental organization, Change Agent Movement, made the call in a statement made available to newsmen and signed by its Chairman and Secretary, Messrs Abolaji Adeosun and Malik Adehun.
The organization explained that Governor Ajimobi left the state on July 9 for no clear reason and he did not hand over the governance of the state to anyone, adding that, governmental activities have been
grounded till today, July 29, 2015. According to the statement, “it is a pity that Oyo people put their trust in the hands of a nonchalant man. The governor left the state on July 9 and up till now, he has not returned. All other governors who joined the President on his official visit to the US on July 20 for three days have returned but Governor Ajimobi is yet to return.
“If he is going on vacation, he should have transferred the mantle of leadership to his deputy. Governor Amosun, who travelled for about 10 days, wrote a letter to the Ogun State House of Assembly nominating his deputy as acting governor. All other governors have towed the same line in the past.
“It is only in Oyo State under Ajimobi that absurdity is seen as norm. The leadership of the NLC also laid credence to how the non-availability of the governor has been affecting workers’ salaries and negotiations about the outstanding. The NLC claimed there was no Secretary to the State Government (SSG) or Commissioner to negotiate with on the modalities for the payment of outstanding salaries since the governor was not around.
“We call on the National Working Committee of the APC and the National leaders of the party especially, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Chief Bisi Akande to call Governor Ajimobi to order because his lack lustre attitude is a negation to governmental activities.
