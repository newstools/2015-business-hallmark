In the wake of the sacking of Super Eagles head coach, Stephen Keshi, feelers reaching Sports Hallmark indicate that Nigeria Football Federation president, Amaju Pinnick may be the next victim of the ‘evolving tsunami’ in the Glass House.
Keshi was relieved of his duty on Saturday after he was found guilty of applying for the vacant post of the Ivory Coast national team which the NFF termed as non-commitment.
However, more drama is billed to be unfolded in the coming days as Pinnick is set to face the consequence of his unholy way of emerging as the NFF boss last year.
The Delta State born Pinnick, is roundly accused of manipulating the process from which he emerged as the winner of the poll held in his home state -which was against the rule- last year.
He was also fingered to have masterminded the ‘arrest’ of Shehu Dikko, the man who was the favourite. On the day of the election, Dikko was charged with terrorism and he could not make it to the election venue.
Although, he is still eligible to be voted for, Pinnick, sensing that if Dikko is taken out of the race, will favour him, allegedly whisked away the electoral committee chairman, with the aid of some security agents.
By the time the Electoral boss returned, ostensibly now acting under duress or might have been financially induced, he announced Dikko’s disqualification.
Pinnick went on to win the President seat after a run-off. Dikko is then placated with the League Management Committee of which he now bosses.
Now, with Keshi gone, it is believed that the searchlight will now be beamed on Pinnick, who some of the board members are already showing the tendency of running a one-man show.
