 A bomb went off near the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, yesterday, but nobody was killed in the incident. The blast occurred when the court was about to rule on whether elections for certain local government officials earlier this year were legal. “I think they were trying to disrupt the result, the high court decided that the election was illegal,” Governor Nyesom Wike said while commenting on the incident. “It (the blast) was close to the high court, nobody was killed and it didn’t affect the building,” he said. However, the Rivers State command of the Nigeria police claimed that it foiled the attempt by arsonists to raze the Federal High Court. There were speculations Thursday morning that two explosions went off at the premises of the court. But the police in the state said there were no explosions as speculated. “There was an unsuccessful attempt to torch the Federal High Court,” police spokesperson in the state, Muhammed Ahmad, disclosed. “It was never an explosion as speculated. Investigation has in earnest commenced.” Ahmad did not provide further details. Earlier reports, however, said the incident occurred “just now as judges settled down for the day’s work. “The court was supposed to hear two cases brought before it by the APC local government chairmen in the state against the Rivers State government. “The local council chairmen had said earlier on local radio stations today that they had withdrawn their case at the Federal High Court to enable them continue with same case at the Industrial Court, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State,”  a journalist in the city, Fyneface Fyneface, had said. Meanwhile, the blast did not prevent the court from sitting as it went ahead to nullify the May 23 local government polls. Justice Lambo Akambo, who gave the verdict, described the conduct of the election by the Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission (RSISEC) as a flagrant disobedience of court’s order.
