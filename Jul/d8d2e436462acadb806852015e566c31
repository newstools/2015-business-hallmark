 ISESELE EZEKIEL, Benin Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has begun search for a credible candidate that it would present to contest against the All Progressive Congress (APC) in next year’s governorship election. Some individuals interested to contest under the PDP are Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, Senator Ehigie Uzamere, Chief Solomon Edebiri, Matthew Iduoriyikemwen and Mike Onolememen. It was learnt that a special committee has been set-up by top hierarchy of the party with a mandate to scout for a popular candidate. A source disclosed that all lawmakers except Ehiozuwa Agbonnayima representing Ikpoba Okha/Egor Federal Constituency attended the meeting where the committee was set-up. The source said Ehiozuwa was barred from the meeting because of his alleged romance with the APC. Ehiozuwa in a telephone chat said he was not barred from any PDP meeting and denied playing APC script at the National Assembly. “National Assembly is not APC or PDP. You do what is in the interest of Nigeria and your constituency once you are a member.” Former Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Roland Owie, had in an interview said he would join other well-meaning leaders of the PDP to scout for a credible candidate who does not have connection with the PDP failed government. “The 2016 governorship will not be based on political platform, it is going to be who that candidate is.  For the PDP to be seen to have broken ranks with irresponsibility, we have to be sure that our candidate for 2016 will not have any relationship with previous failures of the PDP government in Edo”. Former Governor Lucky Igbinedion said the next PDP governor would be a founding member of the party in the state.
