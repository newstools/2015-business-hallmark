 The National President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Dr Felix Omodube, has charged Nigerians to unite to fight all the current challenges facing the nation. Omodube, who made the call during a courtesy visit to the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, expressed optimism that the nation could surmount its present challenges of insecurity, poverty and unemployment, among others, if there was unity of purpose. “Nigerians must be united to fight the common enemies of the nation. If we are united, there is nothing we cannot do with the Almighty God on our side.” The PFN president thanked God for Ekiti State, saying that he followed the politics of the state and believed that the war days were over in the state. He, however, called for cooperation between the executive and legislative arms of government, to move the state to a greater height. “I believe that if the legislature can cooperate with the executive, the people of Ekiti will enjoy more dividends of democracy.” Responding, the Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Mr Kola Oluwawole, solicited more prayers from the Christian body for the success of the present administration. He said that the legislative arm was ready and determined to work with the Governor Ayo Fayose-led executive arm for the people to enjoy more dividends of democracy. The speaker thanked members of the PFN led by their president for the visit. Other members of the Assembly who spoke at the event included the Deputy Speaker, Mr Olusegun Adewumi, and Mr Ekundayo Akinleye (leader of business). Also, Mrs. Titilayo Owolabi-Akerele admonished the Christian body to pray for divine direction for leaders at all levels in the state. The high point of the event was a special prayer led by the PFN president for Ekiti State to overcome the present challenge of kidnapping in the state.
