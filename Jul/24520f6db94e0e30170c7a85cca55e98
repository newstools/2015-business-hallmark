  A Federal High Court in Abuja has declined to stop the police from its on-going investigation of Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu and others in relation to the alleged forgery of the 2015 Standing Rules of the Senate. Justice Gabriel Kolawole in a ruling on Monday refused an ex-parte application filed by Senator Prince Gilbert Emeka Nnaji, with which he sought to among others, restrain the police from proceeding with the investigation and making public the report of the inquiry. Nnaji had sought interim orders to restrain the defendants in the case – the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) – from continuing with the matter, pending the determination of his substantive suit. The plaintiff is challenging the constitutionality of the investigation within the context of the doctrine of separation of power. Justice Kolawole said he could not grant the prayer sought by the plaintiff at ex-parte stage when his court possesses the power to conduct a judicial review of the action complained about in the substantive suit. He also refused the plaintiff’s request to abridge the time within which the defendants could respond.
