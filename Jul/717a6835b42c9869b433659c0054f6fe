The suspect alleged to have obtained the money from some unsuspecting persons, claimed that he would help them acquire some pieces of land being sold by the PHCN. Count one of the charges reads:  “That you, Solomon Yakubu Ndam, on or about the 18th day of May, 2012 at Abuja in the Abuja Judicial Division of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, with intent to defraud did make a forged document titled RE: APPLICATION  FOR PLOT ALLOCATION, REF: 273/ADMIN/20/165/2012, purportedly signed by A.O. Obadofin and issued by the Power Holding Company of Nigeria Plc, Abuja Electricity Distribution Company, acknowledging receipt of payment of the sum of N500,000 (five hundred thousand naira) from you for land allocation with the intention of causing it to be believed as genuine and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 364 of the Penal Code Cap 532, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (Abuja) 1990. The accused pleaded not guilty when the charges were read to him. However, counsel to the accused, J.D Ndam, moved an oral application for bail which was refused by the judge who ordered him to file a written bail application. The prosecution counsel, Samuel Okeleke, opposed the bail application and prayed the court to remand the accused person in prison. Justice Okeke after hearing from both parties ordered the accused to be remanded in prison custody and adjourned the case till September 28, 2015 for   ruling on the bail application.
