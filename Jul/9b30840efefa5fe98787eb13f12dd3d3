 Cuts in… I still wonder why the Boko Haram suspects should be sent to South East. I can’t come to terms yet, and as we speak the suspicion is that some of those suspects are in Owerri and Abakiliki prisons. So far, nobody has explained why the suspects are kept in these prisons far away from the North East, and l think, it is not acceptable.
I believe there are more places to keep them where they come from or at least at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), which belong to everyone. My advice is that the government should return them to where they belong and be tried. We should not be seen to be spreading this problem, but should confine it to a place and that will make it easier to combat it.
