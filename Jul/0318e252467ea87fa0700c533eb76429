  The United States’ government has said that the brutality and barbarism of Boko Haram know no bounds in view of the recent attacks by the insurgents on the countries in the West African region. The US also condemned in strong terms the recent killings of innocent people by Boko Haram in Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria. In a statement yesterday by the US Embassy in Nigeria, the US Department of State’s spokesperson, John Kirby, stated that the US strongly condemned the “horrific and indiscriminate” Boko Haram suicide attacks on the Grand Marche in the Chadian capital of N’Djamena on Saturday, as well as attacks in Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria “over the past two days.” The statement reads, “Boko Haram’s targeting of men, women, and children highlights that the group’s brutality and barbarism know no bounds, and we remain committed to working closely with the region to root out the threat posed by the group. “We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the soldiers, government officials, and civilians killed; we hope those who were injured will recover quickly.” The US government, however, praised the security forces of the three countries for their timely responses to “these callous and cowardly attacks on innocent civilians.” It added, “The United States continues to support the governments and people of the Lake Chad Basin region in their on-going struggle to degrade and defeat Boko Haram. We support these efforts through a number of security and counter-terrorism assistance programmes, including intelligence, advisers, training and equipment.”
