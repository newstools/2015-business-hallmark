 OKUNADE ADEKUNLE Former deputy governor of Lagos State, Femi Pedro, yesterday, appealed to the state House of Assembly to revisit his 2007 impeachment. In a letter read on the floor of the House by the clerk, Ganiyu Abiru, the ex- deputy governor pleaded with the lawmakers to revisit his impeachment on compassionate ground. The clerk added that Pedro’s letter was attached with his letter of resignation while leaving office. Pedro was impeached by the state House of Assembly shortly before the end of former Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s tenure in 2007. Speaking on the issue, Rotimi Olowo, a member of the House representing Shomolu I constituency, told his colleagues to reverse the impeachment, arguing that the tone of the letter showed that the ex-governor has shown remorse for his action while in office. Olowo described Pedro, who is his close friend, as somebody that is upright in character. He said the purpose for carrying out the impeachment in 2007 was not because of fraud or criminal tendencies. “The impeachment was not traceable to fraud or misconduct, but because of high-handedness or lack of respect for constituted authority. Mr. Speaker, I suggest we set up an ad hoc committee to either sustain or revisit the resolution of the 5th Assembly,” the lawmaker said. Abiodun Tobun, a lawmaker representing Epe 1 constituency, however, gave a contrary opinion. He said the 5th Assembly that impeached Pedro had actually done a good job.
