ISAAC OJO, Awka The election petition tribunal sitting in Awka and presided over by Justice Nayai Aganaba has yesterday admitted as exhibits the undisputed documents tendered by the House of Representatives’ candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) for the Njikoka/Anaocha/Dunukofia Federal Constituency election. Mr. Nwankwo who was represented by his counsel, Dr Olatoke Joshua (SAN) presented PWO 1 Engr. Samuel Oreagbunam from Irunebo Village of Enugu-Agidi in Njikoka local government area of the state to identify his earlier documents made available to the tribunal.
Part of the documents tendered and admitted in evidence included the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)-Forms EC8b2, EC8b and EC8C2 a summary of comprehensive results of Njikoka, Dunukofia and Aniocha local government areas which constitute the constituency of the petitioner, Dozie Nwankwo. The counsel to INEC, CB Anyaigbo, Osinachi Nwoye for second respondent (Dr Nnamdi Eze of the PDP) and Chuma Ogwuejiofor for the third respondent (PDP) objected the admissibility of the documents on the grounds that they were not listed as part of the documents to be tendered.
But Olatoke, however countered the objections, pointing out that the move by the lawyers to the respondents is frivolous and a mere attempt to waste the precious time of the tribunal. Justice Nayai Aganaba the chairman of the tribunal ruled that the documents be admitted as exhibits before the election petition tribunal. In a cross examination, the counsel to INEC alleged that the PWO1, Oraegbunam relied on hear say and other documents made available to him by other agents, he however said that he was on ground on the Election Day as a voter, agent and constituency coalition officer. The hearing was however brought to an abrupt end due to the failure of the tribunal registrars to properly arrange the documents needed for the day’s proceedings
