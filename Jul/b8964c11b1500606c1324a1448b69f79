Kaigama, who is also the Arch Bishop of Jos Diocese, made the call during a meeting with the Aku Uka of Wukari, Dr Shekarau Angyu, at the traditional ruler’s palace in Wukari. Kaigama commended the efforts of the Federal Government in the fight against terrorism and urged security operatives to step up intelligence gathering in order to curb the menace of insurgency in the country. He said “the Federal Government is working hard to ensure peace in the country, but this is a collective fight. “There is a tactical move by President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that peace returned but these attacks are guerrilla kinds of attacks which need collective efforts. “Women are now suicide bombers, carrying bombs underneath their wears; people ride on motorcycles and throw bombs, thus making it a difficult war which demands vigilance by all Nigerians to win.” Also, Bishop Charles Hammawa of Jalingo Diocese told the Aku Uka that they were in his palace to sue for peaceful relationship between him and his counterpart in Benue, the Tor Tiv, Dr Alfred Torkura, for permanent peace to reign in their domains. He urged the people of Taraba and Benue to remember their good old days and embrace peace for development to thrive. Responding, the Aku Uka thanked the bishops for their commitment to restore peace in the society. He assured them that the problem between Jukun and Tiv was long over and the two groups were not anticipating any crisis between them again. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Kaigama was accompanied by William Avenya, the Secretary of the Bishops Conference and Bishop of Gboko Diocese, as well as Bishop of Jalingo Diocese, Charles Hammawa. Other bishops who accompanied Kaigama were the Bishop of Katsina Ala Diocese, Peter Adobo and the Bishop of Makurdi Diocese, Wilfred Anagbe.
