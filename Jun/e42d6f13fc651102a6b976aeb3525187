 The Delta Coordinator of State Employment and Expenditure for Results (SEEFOR) project of the World Bank, Mr Benson Ojoko, says about 4,000 youths have been engaged under the programme from 2013 till date. Ojoko disclosed this at a-one-day empowerment training workshop organised by SEEFOR for beneficiaries of the programme in the state on Tuesday in Asaba. According to him, about 4,000 youths have been employed under the SEEFOR programme in the state to create value for the society since the introduction of the programme in 2013 till date. “The 4,000 youths were engaged to maintain roads and refuse collection in the six local government areas where the SEEFOR project is currently implemented. “The six cities where the programme is being implemented in the state are Asaba, Ughelli, Warri, Uvwie, Sapele and Udu,” he said. Ojoko said that the beneficiaries would be trained on money management, entrepreneurship skills and mentorship. He explained that the workshop would help to empower the beneficiaries for entrepreneurship skills, adding that most of the beneficiaries were from poor background with little or no education. According to him, at the end of the training workshop, those who are interested in acquiring vocational and technical skills will be enrolled for further training. Ojoko said that the programme, which was for a period of 12 months for each batch of beneficiaries, was geared toward poverty reduction as well as creating employment for the teeming youths in the state.
