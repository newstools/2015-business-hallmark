 Kunle Awosiyan with BBC report | The authorities of the Nigerian Army has heeded to the order of President Mohammadu Buhari as it concluded arrangement to move the Military Command Headquarters and all Service Chiefs to Maiduguri, Borno State tomorrow. This was contained in a press statement, signed by the Acting Director Army Public Relations, Colonel Sani Kukasheka Usman and a copy of which was made available to Hallmark on Monday. According to the statement, the movement of the command centre ‘Operation Zaman Lafiya’ is in compliance with Presidential pronouncement and the Chief of army Staff’s directive. As at Monday, Hallmark gathered that a reconnaissance and advance team for the establishment of Military Command and Control Centre (MCCC) for Operation Zaman Lafiya for the fight against terrorism and insurgency has moved to Maiduguri, the Borno state capital. The statement said, “The team, which is led by a Two -Star General, has already commenced work in earnest and it is comprised of elements of the officer of the Chief of Army Staff, all the relevant Army Headquarters Departments and other combat support components. The centre will serve as a forward command base for the Chief of Army Staff and other service chiefs. The centre is essentially an elaboration of an already existing Army Headquarters Command and Control arrangement. From now on, the fight against terrorism and insurgency would be monitored, coordinated and controlled from this centre. I wish to inform you also that its establishment would not create another layer of Command structure but would add impetus and renewed vigour to Operation Zaman Lafiya, all aimed at bringing terrorism and insurgency to an end. “However, an alternate command centre is also being established in Yola, the Adamawa state capital of the north east”. Colonel Usman stated.
