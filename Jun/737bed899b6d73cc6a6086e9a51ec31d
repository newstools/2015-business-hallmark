Flying Eagles coach, Manu Garba, is considering quitting the job after leading the team to the last 16 of the FIFA U-20 World Cup in New Zealand. The Africa champions, which came second behind Brazil in its group, crashed out of the competition in the second round after losing 1-0 to Germany last Thursday. Garba, who led Golden Eaglets to win the FIFA U-17 World Cup in UAE last two years, has asked the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to appoint a new coach that would carry the responsibility of taking the team to a higher ground before the next qualifying series. “Everybody has gone home for now, so its left for the NFF to decide on whoever they’re giving the job to start to build a strong team before the next qualifiers. I appreciate the support of the Federation and entire country.” Garba also revealed that Kelechi Iheanacho’s inability not to make the first team shirt was due to the player’s poor fitness level. Iheanacho made just one start against Brazil where the team lost 4-2 before losing his place to Kingsley Sokari in subsequent matches at New Zealand. “When we played Iheanacho in the first match he wasn’t very confident with his marking and coupled with that we had a small problem in the Midfield. “He had not been with the team for long and so it affected communication with the other players,’ Garba said. “We re-jigged the team and you’ll remember that new side defeated North Korea and Hungary. And no Coach will necessarily change a winning team.”
