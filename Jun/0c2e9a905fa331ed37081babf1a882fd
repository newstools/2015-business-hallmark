 Opeyemi Oshoko | More than 25 people have been killed and several others injured in a bomb explosion that occurred at the Cattle Market (Kasuwan Shanu) Maiduguri, the  Borno State capital, on Tuesday. The incident, believed by many to be another attack by Boko Haram took place at about 2pm when market activity was at its peak. This is coming less than five hours that President Muhammadu Buhari met with the National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd.) to find solution to the insurgence. The meeting, according to a source was concerned about the renewed attacks by the sect and the plan to relocate the command centre to Maiduguri. It was also gathered that Buhari would visit Niger and Chad to fortify their cooperation with Nigeria on how to fight the Boko Haram. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on, said the President would travel to Chad and Niger for talks on the Boko Haram menace. This will be the President’s first official visit outside the country since assuming office, Senior Special Assistant to the president on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu has said. According to Shehu, the two-day trip, will focus on “matters of security,” because Nigeria needs the cooperation of its neighbours to succeed in its campaign against the terrorist sect whose activities have so far claimed an estimated over 15,000 lives since 2009. He said, “Buhari will go to Niger Republic on Wednesday and will spend a night there before proceeding to Chad the next day (Thursday).”
