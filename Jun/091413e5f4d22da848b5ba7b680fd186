 Disgraced former FIFA official Chuck Blazer worked undercover to help the authorities with their investigation into corruption within football’s global governing body. Back in November 2013, Blazer pleaded guilty to 10 charges including racketeering conspiracy, money laundering and tax evasion. As part of his plea, the 70-year-old agreed to feed the authorities information pertaining to their investigation. The 19-page agreement was unsealed on Monday, and includes references to agreements between Blazer and the United States government dating back to December 2011. “The defendant agrees to furnish to the office all documents and other material that may be relevant to the investigation and that are in the defendant’s possession or control and to participate in undercover activities pursuant to the specific instructions of law enforcement agents or this office,” the agreement read. “The defendant agrees not to reveal his cooperation, or any information derived there from, to any third party without prior consent of the office.” The revelations are the latest to become public in the ongoing FIFA corruption scandal, which has tarnished the organisation’s reputation and led to President Sepp Blatter announcing his intention to step down.
