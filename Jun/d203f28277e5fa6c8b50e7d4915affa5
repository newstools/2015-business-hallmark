Two Nollywood big “wigs”,Biodun Okeowo and Wura Adesegha popularly known as Wura Gold are at each other throat.The two who have choosen to wash their dirty linen in the public accused each other of being a lesbian.
According to the information at our disposal, all efforts made by friends and colleagues to settle the rift between them proved abortive.
Days ago,Biodun Okeowo took to her BBM and posted “Wura Adesegha, everybody knows you are a stupid alabosi…as you have cursed my my kids so you shall not reap the fruit of your own kid too” as her personal message and someone close to them was said to have inquired why the light complexioned actress went to that extent and she revealed Wura tried to lure her into lesbianism
She said “Wura was my friend before and we were very good friends but I started to give her space when I started realizing the kind of person she truly was.
She told me she wants us to become lovers as in becoming Lesbians partner,I told her I wasn’t interested..And that was it. Wura started going around calling me names”
“And recently when some people called me Wura’s friend, I told them she is not my friend at least not anymore. And Liz Da Silva decided to settle the rift; she called us on a conference and when I told her why Wura was fighting me,Wura started to curse me and my children,that was what prompted by BBM update” she further explained.
Wura was however called to ask about her side of the story and she revealed it was the other way round.
“On the contrary it was Biodun okewo that asked me to become her lover and I turned her down, why would she turn things around.You can go and ask the likes of Anita Julius and Liz Dasilva at least they have slept in my house,if there was ever a time I made such silly advances at any of them” she said
