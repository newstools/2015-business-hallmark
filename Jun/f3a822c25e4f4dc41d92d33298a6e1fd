The immediate past Special Adviser on Education to Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola, and a Cheiftain of the All Progressives Congress in Lagos, Hon AbdulFatai Olukoga, has said that the influence of the National Leader of the party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, cannot be undermined by the group loyal to the Former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, stating that the labour of Tinubu for the success of the party should not be allowed to go in vein.
The Former Special Adviser, who said this in an exclusive interview with Hallmark, explained that there is need for the party to instill discipline among its ranks and file, stating that further that outcome of the National Assembly leadership election was a palace coup planned against the Southwest and Tinubu.
Olukoga stated that the crisis going on in the party would not derail the party and President Muhammed Buhari from delivering on the promises to the citizens, stressing that the APC led administration will provide the needed social services by the people.
“What is really happening in the National Assembly shows that the party needs to instill discipline among the ranks and file of the party. Let me tell you that in short what happened during the National Assembly leadership election was a palace coup against the Southwest targeted to undermine Tinubu. If the party gives directive, as a loyal party member you have to stand by the directive”, said Olukoga
“APC will not derail like the PDP because of the crisis and even President Buhari would deliver the promises made to the citizenry during campaign. Our party will provide the necessary social services to the people.  We will deliver on our mandate”, said Olukoga
Enunciating his achievement as Special Adviser, Olukoga stated that it was during his time that most of the tertiary institutions in the state got accredited, adding that he made it mandatory for all tertiary institutions administrators to ensure that all graduands get their certificate on the day of their convocation.
“It was under my watch as Special Adviser on Education that most of the tertiary institutions were accredited and all graduands always go home with their certificates on the day of convocation”, said Olukoga
Speaking on his expectation from the Governor of Lagos, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, he urged that Ambode should work more on revenue generation, project monitoring, security and education, adding that the governor should intensify more effort in decongesting traffic in the state.
