 Kunle Awosiyan | Lagos State Governor Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode has approved the construction of a pedestrian bridge at Ojodu Berger Bus Stop. He disclosed this on Thursday during his visit to some of the major traffic flaspoints in the metropolis, stating that he has approved the bridge as parts of his plans to solve traffic snarls in the state. He said, “We have seen that Berger needs a foot bridge and immediately the engineers are going to go to work and we will make sure that we put something there.In addition to the footbridge, the state government would also ensure that it makes the road free at all times, because whatever happens there, will have a backlash on the 3rd Mainland bridge which can even extend to the Oworonshoki end.” “We’ve been to 3rd Mainland, Oworonshoki, Ketu, Abule-Egba, Alimosho and Mile 12. That’s not the end of the story. We’re still going to Apapa and Mile 2. The truth is that we must start to have solutions to our traffic challenges in the state and that’s what we are doing. The governor also said that his administration would create traffic lights at Dopemu area of the state and expand the road at the two ends so that people could turn easily without causing hindrance. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Mr. Seyi Coker who also spoke, expressed optimism that with the inspection Lagosians would see some improvement on the roads. Coker recalled that Governor Ambode on assumption of office directed that the Ministry of Transportation identify problematic traffic points in the metropolis which the ministry complied with immediately.
