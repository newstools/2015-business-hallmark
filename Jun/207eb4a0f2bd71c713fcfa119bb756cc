The mother of two who has released several albums recently spoke with YINKA LAWAL about the entertainment industry, family, and sundry issues What has been happening to you all this while? I have been going in and out of the country. At a time I relocated permanently but I am back to Nigeria now.  A lot has been read about BusolaOke, but how soon do you think you can achieve the feat your Eleyele hit struck? Everything in life depends on God and the individual’s ability and struggle. For me Busola, I am doing all I can to attain my dream place in this chosen career and to make my fans proud of me and with God all things are possible. I am working very hard to become even better than what is expected of me  What differentiates a gospel artist from an inspirational singer? An inspirational singer sings reality songs and he or she sings from a natural source; something that will move you or remind you of something that is real, something that will touch your soul and also pass a message but, a gospel artiste is like a minister of God. His or her song might either be preaching the gospel or praising and appreciating God through songs  What does love mean to you? Love in the real sense of it means a special gift from God because true love is not easy to come by and when, I see true love I really appreciate it because to me, who ever owns or has true love has it all  For a female artist, what would you refer to as the challenges of the entertainment industry? I will mention three if you don’t mind: piracy, bad marketers and promoters, and lastly substandard music.  You are famous for your Eleyele hit; do you think there is still a market for your kind of music inside and outside Nigeria? Thank God for Eleyele but my kind of music is the Original African beat and style. It’s not of the western world or imitations, it is real and anything that is real makes way anywhere and everywhere but at the same time I am not the best yet; my music is not the best yet and there is still room for amendment and more improvement.  It is generally believed that marriage takes female artistes to the back seat; as a married woman, how true is this? For me, my marriage is not affecting me in anyway but at the same time as a cultural person I must also put my marriage into consideration in everything I do. But I don’t see how it affects me as a person because my husband is my biggest fan and also my biggest promoter on account of his immense encouragement, both morally and financially, when it comes to my career  Personally, what would you say inspires your compositions? My compositions comes from my natural inspiration, from God and my everyday life.  Do you write and compose all your songs or do you hire people to do that for you? I write and compose all my songs  As a lady, what is the weirdest thing a female fan had told you? (Laughs)I can’t believe I am finally sharing this. One day, a female fan called me and said: ‘BusolaOke, what is it about you that my husband is going crazy for? He even told me that I must learn and know how to sing all your songs and also wear your hairstyles. BusolaOke, who are you? What planet are you from? What is special about you?’  I was so shocked and short of words.  How would you describe yourself? I am a goal getter  What are your plans for the year? This year is going to be a very busy one for me because I have a lot of projects on the table. For example, I will releasing the album of my first artiste, Segun Royal, my personal video, Emimimo, land my foundation and clothing line; and finally Introducing my New Music Concept  As a beautiful lady how often do you get advances from men? Like Jack Robinson (laughing). I mean every second, every minute, every day and time. To be realistic this is very common and I must say I am used to advances from the opposite sex but for someone with focus and determination it’s easy to handle  Doesn’t your husband get jealous? (Laughs) Can you show me just one man that doesn’t get jealous? Only if the person is Jesus or Prophet Muhammed  Can you let us into the man in your life? My man is an introvert. He doesn’t like publicity and loves his privacy I don’t bring him into my career and he doesn’t bring me into his business as well. He is not a showbiz person. I chose this path because of my talent and he is a businessman  How did you meet? Our meeting was divine but I don’t want to talk about my husband, the most important thing is that I love him and he loves me too  Since you had the car crash early last year, how have you been and do you still experience the trauma? I am perfectly alright now but I still have this weird feeling each time I start my car or see a big truck while driving on the express .It reminds me of the accident. I really must be factual.  What drives your passion? Good music and good people  Apart from music, what else does BukolaEleyele do? Asides music, BusolaOkeEleyele is a professional caterer, a cloth designer and an event planner  Your advice to young women ? My advice to our young women is for them to have focus, learn to be strong, be determined and to believe in themselves, not in anybody.
