LUKMAN OLOGUNRO Vincent Enyeama has explained that he was not officially asked to attend a Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) disciplinary committee on Tuesday.
The goalkeeper stated he finds as strange, the decision of the NFF to charge him for his remark ahead of Nigeria’s Nations Cup qualifier clash with Chad in Kaduna on June 13 declaring he has been told to apologise which he did.
The NFF feels that Enyeama was in breach of its code of conduct. But the goalkeeper said, he got no letter asking him to report to the disciplinary committee.
“I only received a letter to cautioning me about it [my comments] and to avoid a repeat of such,” he told BBC Sport.
He explained further, “Personally, as it was resolved in-house I thought that was the end of the matter.
“But I only found out about a disciplinary hearing in the media but I didn’t get any letter to that effect.”
The Lille FC shot stopper made incendiary remarks about security in Kaduna ahead the match which Nigeria won 2-0.
“I respect my country and those in charge of our football, which is why I find the whole thing strange,” he said.
“As the captain I only raised our concerns about the venue before our game which didn’t go down well with the football authority.
“I was told to apologise for my comments, which I did immediately and they told me that’s fine.”
But the 32-year-old, who is the Super Eagles most capped player with 101 appearances, denies he failed to reply to messages from the NFF seeking an explanation for his comments.
The former Enyimba goalkeeper could face a lengthy ban for his comments which the NFF feels broke its recent code of conduct signed by the players as well as his failure to attend Tuesday’s hearing.
The NFF executive board will have the final say on any punishments, on a date yet to be decided.
It was also confirmed that the Super Eagles will play their next home qualifier against Egypt in Kaduna next March.
