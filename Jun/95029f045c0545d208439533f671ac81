  An Edo man invited his friends for his father’s burial. After lowering the coffin, the family put yam, rice, meat, etc, into the grave in line with tradition. A Hausa man asked why? The Edo man smiled and said, ”according to our tradition, the dead go on a long journey and need all the food items they can get. The Hausa man dropped N100,000 inside and said, ”when the food finish, buy more.” The Yoruba man around followed suit and dropped N50,000 and said, ”add this in case it’s not enough.” Then the Igbo man there smiled and brought out his cheque book and wrote a cheque of N200,000, dropped it in the coffin and took the N150,000 notes as change, then said. ”Nwanne, withdraw it when you reach there… It is going to be a dangerous journey, we don’t know how many robbers are out there and again we are in a cashless economy.
