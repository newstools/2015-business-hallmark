There are indications that the US Authorities may question FIFA President Sepp Blatter  as part of their corruption inquiry into football’s governing body, The New York Times has reported. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2172 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sepp_Blatter_2576177b-300x188.jpg?resize=300%2C188" alt="Sepp_Blatter_2576177b" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sepp_Blatter_2576177b.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sepp_Blatter_2576177b.jpg?resize=150%2C94&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sepp_Blatter_2576177b.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Though Blatter, who announced on Tuesday that he would be resigning from his position, has not been directly implicated in the parallel US and Swiss criminal investigations into FIFA, which were announced last week. Unidentified US law enforcement officials, however, told the NYT that “they were hoping to win the cooperation of some of the FIFA officials now under indictment and work their way up the organisation” in a bid to build case against Blatter.
