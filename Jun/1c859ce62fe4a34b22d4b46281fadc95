  The National Association of Nigerian Travel Agencies (NANTA) on Thursday said travel agents contributed $2.3 billion (about N460 billion) to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2014. The National President, NANTA, Alhaji Aminu Agoha, disclosed this at a news conference in Lagos. According to him, the amount is derived from ticket sales. Agoha said that the efforts of the agents should be encouraged and protected by the government, especially in the area of regulating airline ticket sales. He decried the situation where some commercial banks were engaged in the selling of tickets, while appealing to the CBN to call them to order. “There is need for government to protect the interests of travel agents who contributed over $2.3 billion to the country last year from ticket sales and tour packages. “One of the burning issues is the sale of airline tickets by Nigerian Banks. “Recently, the general public has been inundated with adverts by banks making ridiculous offers to the general public for the purchase of air tickets from such banks. “This growing trend portrays a dangerous situation whereby the banks have abandoned their core business of providing financial services to the public. “If the CBN does not call the banks to order, our members will be pushed out of business,” Agoha said. According to him, travel agents undergo a rigorous accreditation process before they are allowed to sell airline tickets. He also expressed dissatisfaction with the state of facilities at the Lagos, Kano and Port Harcourt International Airports.
