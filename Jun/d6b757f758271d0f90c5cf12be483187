 The All Progressives Congress (APC) has given assurances that it would provide a level playing field for legislators to choose their leaders. National Chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, said this in an interview with reporters, in Abuja, yesterday. Odigie-Oyegun spoke shortly after he led members of the National Working Committee of the APC to a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at Defence House. He was responding to a question on whether the APC, which enjoys a majority in the National Assembly, can afford a crisis over the choice of its leaders. “There will be no crisis. I want to give you that assurance, we are very conscious of the fact that the national assembly is a separate arm of government and the law provides, the constitution provides that they are the ones responsible for electing their own officers all we are going to do is provide for them a conducive environment.” Odigie-Oyegun also said, President Buhari was putting together his ministerial list in consultation with the party. He noted that the President is a loyal party man who was always carrying the party along in his decisions. “All I can say is this, Mr. President is committed to carrying the party along in everything that he does and we are very grateful for that, and he has always been like that. “He has put the party in the front burner in his consideration at all times.” Earlier, the party chairman who was accompanied by his colleagues said they were at Defence House to pay their respects to the President. He explained that they have not been able to do so before now because they were waiting for the inauguration. Odigie-Oyegun also said the visit provided them the opportunity to pledge their support and loyalty to him as he sets about the task of rebuilding the nation. According to him, all of those at the meeting agreed that the expectations of Nigerians are extremely high but that with the support of the party and members of the public the President will perform.
