Governor Kashim Shettima had sent list of 40 nominees to the Assembly, but the members approved 20. The Speaker, Alhaji Abdulkarim Lawal, said yesterday at the plenary session that the reduction was due to the stateâ€™s financial position, as well as to check the cost of governance. The motion for the reduction of the number of advisers was moved by Alhaji Mohammad Zakari, the House Leader. In another development, the speaker announced the appointment of Mr Ayuba Wukawa, representing Hawul Constituency, as the Deputy House Leader, and Alhaji Audu Mustapha, representing Magumeri Constituency as the Chief Whip.
