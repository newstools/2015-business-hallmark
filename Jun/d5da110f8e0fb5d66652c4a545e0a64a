 Kunle Awosiyan | Telecoms giant, MTN Nigeria said it spent N8billion worth of diesel yearly to run its facilities especially the Base Station Transceiver Stations (BTS). The Corporate Services Executive, Mr Akinwale Goodluck said this on Wednesday, adding that the huge cost chopped off 60 percent of its operation cost of doing business in the country. “The company has continued to stagger under heavy cost of diesel used to run generating sets at its cell sites. The huge amount spent on diesel, generating sets and other associated expenses could otherwise be spent on network expansion towards providing better services to the growing telecoms consumers. What we spend on diesel in Nigeria is two or three times higher than what we spend in other African countries,” he said. He explained, “Our efforts to positively contribute to people’s lives are clear in the products and services we provide. This is how we create sustainable economic value for both our business and stakeholders.”
