Yinka Morufat Lawal  | The Exams Ethics Marshal International has called on WAEC, NECO, JAMB and NABTEB to impose stiffer sanctions on candidates involved in examination malpractices.  The organization made this call in a communiqué, signed by its Founding Chairman, Ike Onyechere, a copy of which was given to Hallmark News on Monday.  It said that between 1996 when the Exam Ethics Marshals Movement started in Nigeria and 2014, the West African Examination Council, National Examination Council, National Teachers Institute, National Business and Technical Examination Board and Joint Admission and Matriculation Board had organized examinations for about 76 million candidates out of which the results of over nine million were cancelled over malpractices.  According to the communiqué, in its 2010 May/June Senior Secondary Certificate Examinations, the National Examination Council, for example, reported 615,010 cases of malpractices out of a total of 1,113,177 candidates that sat for the examination and 439,529 cases of malpractice for the 2011 May/June Examinations.  Exams Marshal condemned the examination bodies, saying “Despite cancellation of results, no other sanctions were imposed, even when section 16 of the Examination Malpractice Act of 1999 is clear on what actions examination bodies should take.”  Exams Marshal noted that WAEC had refused to prosecute many of its fraudulent candidates and officers despite, even when the International Examinations Committee for the council had given approval for National offices to publish names of candidates involved in exam fraud in Newspapers.  “The fact that sections19, 20, 21 and 22 of the WAEC Act are also clear on sanctions. It was based on these approvals that the names, exam numbers and pictures of Ghanaian WAEC candidates involved exam malpractice were published in Daily Graphic Newspaper of September 4, 2009.  The names, exam numbers and pictures of candidates involved in exam malpractice in Nigeria should be published in newspapers as is the case in other West African Countries,” it said.
