On Thursday, 25th, June the Lekki phase 1 home of Nollywood actress,Kate Henshaw was gutted by fire . The house we gathered caught fire shortly after PHCN restored light. Though,no one was injured in the inferno but we gathered the dark complexioned actress lost lot of indoor valuables. A source said that no sooner than the fire outbreak started that neighbours rallied round to help put out the fire.
The talented actress was seen moving out of the building days ago, we gathered she would be staying in another apartment.
Before the incident,the Cross-River State born diva was on Wednesday spotted at Industry night where JJCâ€™ had his album listening party
