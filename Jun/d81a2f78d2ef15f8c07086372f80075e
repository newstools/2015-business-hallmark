 The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), has urged Nigerians to keep their savings with banks duly insured by the corporation to avert unnecessary risk. The Zonal Controller of NDIC in Port Harcourt, Mr Chibuzor Onwumere, made the call at a one-day sensitisation workshop for members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) deployed to Akwa-Ibom. He warned that customers who deposited in uninsured financial institutions would fail to get indemnified and reimbursed in the event of insolvency. Onwumere advised the corps members to relate with insured banks to be able to secure loans that would assist them in building their future. “When you keep money in the bank, your money is safe from theft, loss and fire. “ You can get money quickly and easily and you can use the bank to transfer fund from one location to another instead of carrying cash around. “Using a bank to transact business is cheaper than using other forms of doing same and building a relationship with a bank can help you save money, plan investment for future. “The bank will also help you to access a loan as well as get paid interest on your savings. “One other important thing to know is that in case of a bank failure, your money is safe since your money is insured by the NDIC. “The NDIC guarantees payment of deposits up to a maximum amount if a bank fails.” According to him, the NDIC is mandated to ensure that failing and failed insured institutions are resolved in timely manner. He said that this was done through the provision of financial and technical assistance as well as take-over of control and organisation of bridge banks.
