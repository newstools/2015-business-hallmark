The industry has gone through various levels of development from the manual based processes to more technologically advanced production methods. However, the level of development of the sector in Nigeria is still low when compared to other countries with more advanced technical know-how. The Nigerian paint sector is a highly competitive one. There is free entry and exit due to the rather friendly capital required to set up the business. One major critical success factor for chemical and paints operators in Nigeria is quality control. Manufacturers in Nigeria are classified into tiers on the basis of the quality of their final products. An effective and efficient distribution network is also a key requirement for the success of paint manufacturers in Nigeria. Since paints are in high demand in virtually all areas of the country, it is pertinent that the end product gets to the final consumer as at when needed.
