Hon. Yakubu Dogara has emerged Speaker House of Representatives after polling 182 votes to beat Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila of Surulere  constituency 1 of Lagos State who polled 174 votes in a keenly contested race. This is coming barely four hours after Senator Bukola Saraki  emerged president of the senate. The results of the two elections at the lower and upper chambers of the National Assembly saw the two adopted candidates of APC, Senator Ahmed Lawan and Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila at the losers end. This, according to Hallmark investigation is a result of the alliance between PDP caucus and the aggrieved members of the APC who had earlier protested the imposition of candidates. Dogara represents Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa-Balewa Federal constituency of Bauchi State.
