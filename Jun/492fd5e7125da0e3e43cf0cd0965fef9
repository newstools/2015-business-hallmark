Adekunle Sijuade | A diesel tanker crashed and burst into flame early Saturday morning at Idimu Area of Lagos consuming about 20 houses. An eyewitness called Hallmark News on phone, adding that pkoihe spillage flew into the adjacent buildings where it later turned to serious inferno. The loss would have been more than this, according to the eyewitness but the quick intervention of the residents in the area saved the situation. However there were no indications that life was lost, the South-West Public Relations Officer of the National Emergency Management Agency, Ibrahim Farinloye, told Hallmark News that the various sensitization programmes by the NEMA had helped. “The residents should be commended for their response; they evacuated immediately the affected people living in the area,” he said.
