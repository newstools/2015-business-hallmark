 Kunle Awosiyan | The All Progressives Congress (APC) has kicked against the emergence of Senator Bukola Saraki and Hon. Yakubu Dogara as the Senate President and Speaker House of Representatives respectively. The party said in a statement issued in Abuja on Tuesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Lai Mohammed as it described as totally unacceptable and the highest level of indiscipline and treachery the conduct of Tuesday’s inauguration of the National Assembly that led to the emergence of Senator Bukola Saraki and Hon Yakubu Dogara as Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives, respectively. It stated that Senator Saraki and Hon. Dogara were not the candidates of the APC and a majority of its National Assembly members-elect for the positions of Senate President and House Speaker. According to him, the party duly met and conducted a straw poll and clear candidates emerged for the posts of Senate President, Deputy Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives, supported by a majority of all Senators-elect and members-elect of the House of Representatives. “All National Assembly members-elect who emerged on the platform of the party are bound by that decision. The party is supreme and its interest is superior to that of its individual members,” the statement read. APC decried a situation in which some people, based on nothing but inordinate ambition and lack of discipline and loyalty, will enter into an unholy alliance with the very same people whom the party and indeed the entire country worked hard to replace and sell out the hard won victory of the Party. “There can be no higher level of treachery, disloyalty and insincerity within any party, the party will use all constitutional and legal means available to it. Meanwhile, the APC has asked all its loyal Senators-elect to please report to the Senate to be sworn-in in order to discharge their constitutional duties,” the statement said.
