GOAL.COM| Saviour Godwin’s brace fired Nigeria to the brink of qualification for the last-16 as they beat Korea DPR 4-0 at the Stadium Taranaki and knocked them out of the Fifa U20 World Cup. After a shaky first half where they failed to cage the Asians despite having several scoring chances with goalkeeper Cha Jong Hun putting in a great performance that halted the Flying Eagles’ forward, the reigning African youth champions put up a commanding second half display for their first win of the competition. Captain Musa Muhammed’s  rocket which hit the inside of the post from 25 yards as Jong Hun looked on was Manu Garba’s side best chance in the first half. Also, Korea DPR last man pulled off a fantastic save off Taiwo Awoniyi’s follow-up free-kick by Muhammed. Three minutes into the second half, Godwin put his team in front after Jong Hun misjudged Bernard Bulbwa’s cross. In the 51st minute, he doubled his strike with a cool finish in between the legs of defender and goalkeeper after being fed by Awoniyi who skillfully found his way into the Asians’ backline. Nigeria’s third was a fantastic one from Kingsley Sokari as his laser-guided shot from the edge of the area screamed into the top left corner. Substitute Success Isaac got the fourth after exchanging passes with Awoniyi, exchanged passes and sliced through the Korea DPR defence before the latter slammed home from a tight angle to reinstate the African champions’ last 16 hopes. The win leaves Nigeria second in Group E and requiring either a point from their group finale with Hungary to confirm a place to the second round.
