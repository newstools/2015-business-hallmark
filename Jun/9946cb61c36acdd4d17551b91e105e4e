The broker is impressed with the audited result which revealed that profits were ahead of market expectations as well as the mouth-watering dividend appropriated. They described CAP Plc as stock “with enormous potential” for growth as reflected in its stock performance and audited financial report. Mr. Willy Ndata, the Doyen of stockbroker, said “it is the undisputable leader in the paints industry because its product brand, Dulux, which is of durable quality. It has been in the field of paint manufacturing for a long time and consistent in payment of dividend in the last 7 years. As the consumers’ preference among others, it is a good “buy” for investors in its shares any day.” The broker believes in the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and have no reason to believe it will not remain a going concern in the year ahead. Industry Perspective: The chemical and paints industry has been in existence for a number of years. The industry has gone through various levels of development from the manual based processes to more technologically advanced production methods. However, the level of development of the sector in Nigeria is still low when compared to other countries with more advanced technical know-how. The Nigerian paint sector is a highly competitive one. There is free entry and exit due to the rather friendly capital required to set up the business. One major critical success factor for chemical and paints operators in Nigeria is quality control. Manufacturers in Nigeria are classified into tiers on the basis of the quality of their final products. An effective and efficient distribution network is also a key requirement for the success of paint manufacturers in Nigeria. Since paints are in high demand in virtually all areas of the country, it is pertinent that the end product gets to the final consumer as at when needed.
