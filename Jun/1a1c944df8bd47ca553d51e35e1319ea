 President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday evening finally moved into his official residence in the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had lived outside the Villa and used the Defence House, Abuja, as their offices since their inauguration three weeks ago in order to allow renovation works to be carried out at the facility. Buhari’s delay in relocation had attracted controversy with rumours spreading that the president had hired Senegalese spiritualists to cleanse the premises. These reports were, however, laid to rest by the Presidency, which said that the president hadn’t relocated due to on-going renovations in the official quarters. However, Buhari, who returned to Abuja from Katsina State on Saturday, began the movement of his properties to the seat of power on Sunday evening. The president’s wife, Aisha Buhari, had moved into the official residence since last Thursday. It was gathered that the president’s wife relocated to the Presidential Villa in the evening of Thursday, June 18, 2015, while her husband was travelling home for Ramadan. “She had relocated ahead of her husband. She passed the night here,” an unnamed source at the Buhari administration had disclosed. Aso Rock was more busy than usual last Friday. Some exotic cars were parked in front of the premises. Sources said that some honourable guests were paying a visit to Aisha Buhari. Vice President Osinbajo and his wife have not relocated to the villa yet. Their plans remain unclear.
