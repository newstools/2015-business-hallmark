 Real Madrid Castilla defender Derik Osede has revealed his intention to represent Nigeria at international level. Derik, 22, has played for Spain’s youth sides, most recently recording two caps for their under-21 team. However, the centre-back, who is contracted to Real’s B side, wishes to be called up by Nigeria’s senior side, as his father is Nigerian. “I have lived in Spain all my life and I am not sure the people in Nigeria are aware that I have Nigerian blood,” Derik, who was born in Madrid, told the BBC. “But I crave for something special with Nigeria because it will give me a chance to properly connect with the ancestral home of my father. “My father is from Benin City [southern Nigeria] and even though I have never been there I always follow events in Nigeria. “I celebrated when the country won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and I was cheering the team at the last World Cup in Brazil. “Even if it’s difficult for some people to understand, I have made my decision [to represent Nigeria] and am going to stick to it. “My father has not influenced my decision in any way. I respect him and adore his outlook on life but it’s my personal desire to play for Nigeria.”
