By Yinka Lawal | The authorities of Imo State Polytechnic, Umuagwo in Ohaji/Egbema Local Government Area, has expelled 389 students over their involvement in examination and admission malpractices The Rector of the institution, Rev. Fr. Wence Madu, said most of the affected students were engaged in one examination malpractice or the other, some did not enter the school through the right way while some others failed to abide by the institution’s rules and regulations.  He further explained that measures have been put in place to fish out all those who entered the institution through the backdoor, adding that anyone caught will be shown the way out.
Fr. Madu, who reaffirmed the institution’s zero tolerance for examination malpractice, cultism and other vices, said the management is poised to repositioning the polytechnic so that its graduates can effectively compete favourably in the labour market.
He said the era of sorting/ bribery for admission is over and charged students and those seeking to enter the school to concentrate on their studies so that they can earn good scores by merit rather than by hook and crook. He maintained that only students who genuinely gained admission into the institution would be admitted. He also advised those involved in admission racketeering to desist from the school or be ready to face the wrath of law
