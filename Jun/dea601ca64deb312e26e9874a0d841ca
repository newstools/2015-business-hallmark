BY UCHE AKOLISA Once upon a time, Omo detergent from the stables of Unilever was the Numero uno of the detergent market in Nigeria. In those days, the exploits of the giant as detergent of choice dwarfed the performance of rivals as it boxed the likes of Elephant(PZ Cusson) and Surf detergents(Unilever) into a tight corner. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3830 alignleft" src="http://hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/arieal-197x300.jpg" alt="arieal" width="197" height="300" srcset="https://hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/arieal-197x300.jpg 197w, https://hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/arieal-99x150.jpg 99w, https://hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/arieal.jpg 235w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px" />Its popularity was such that its supersonic television commercials which promised that, “Super Blue Omo washes brighter and it shows’ was an anthem among children who grew up in the 80s. The Lord of the ring also became the generic name for detergents in Nigeria. However, Omo has lost that peak position to Ariel, the new market leader. Yet it was not the mermaid that undid the giant, a smaller contender, So Klin, did. The entrance of Eko Supreme Resources-marketed So klin in 1996 was the beginning of fall of the giant.  So Klin which started nibbling at the fringes of Omo’s market share came into the market with an innovation – white detergent, an industry first. In addition,    its offer of a detergent with a deep-washing function gave Nigerians new reasons to switch. With So Klin, they do not need spend extra money to buy bleach to do their white laundry as against blue Omo which they suddenly noticed turned their white clothes, blue. According to a consumer, Stella Chima ,  “So-Klin removes stains faster and makes my clothes, especially white, brighter.”  The fact that So Klin comes in small affordable sachet added another perk to its handful of benefits. Omo’s brand complacence Analysts believe that brand complacence and ingenuity of competitors’ innovations were at the heart of Omo’s decline. When market dynamics turned and consumer taste changed, the  Omo brand was either too arrogant or too deaf  (or both)  to notice that tunes from the talking drum sounding in the market  have changed and that it needed to change its dance steps. It ignored light but stragetic punches feather-weighted So Klin was pulling at the time. However, the template for decimating Omo which was initiated by So Klin was played to the hilt by Ariel a late comer to the detergent market. Because at the beginning So klin(perhaps, due to its sheer size)  was more interested in marketing than brand-building, it left the opportunity for Ariel which was first launched in 1998 to upstaged the competition in the detergent market. Unlike So Klin, Ariel boasts a rich parentage that could match Omo’s parent brand money for money, in terms of investment in research and development, advertising and marketing support and distribution logistics. In 2010, Ariel upgraded  with a technology that introduced more enzymes and polymers that remove tough stains in ‘one wash that most detergents can’t remove in two washes,’ became the tagline, which other detergent brands have tried to tweak thereafter. “Ariel washes better, retains colour and leaves a good scent”, submitted Nduka Abili. A house wife, Ijeoma Gloria, prefers Ariel because, “it removes stains.” Chima however added that he goes for Ariel when she could not get Klin because of its unique fragrance.  Sunday Nwaogu likes to do his washings with Ariel; because it washes faster and brightens his clothes In terms of visibility, Omo is still ubiquitous and can be found in almost every stall but it places a distant third in terms of consumer preference, Hallmark checks revealed. Confirming Omo’s fall from apogee, a retailer in Ikeja, Mrs Esther Ogunlade told Hallmark that Ariel is the highest selling detergent in the market. “Omo does not ‘move’ like it used to again. Ariel is the fastest-selling detergent, followed by So Klin.” “Even Sunlight sells more than Omo now,” she added. Corroborating her, two supermarket owners in Ogba and Berger, Lagos, who spoke in separate chat with Hallmark on condition of anonymity said that Ariel tops their sales of detergents. But some conservatives like Nkrumah Bankong and Friday Olokor have stayed faithful to Omo. According to Bankong, ‘Omo washes faster and clean.’  Olokor ‘s loyalty is generational. He grew up using it. “It’s been a popular brand,” he said, adding, “We(his family) like the fragrance and the quality has improved.” Like the Biblical Esau who did all he could to reclaim his lost birthright to no avail, Omo has tried lots of tricks in the hat regain its lost market position. It has changed from blue to white detergents, revitalized the product for an improved wash, tried celebrity endorsements with the likes of  Bukky Wright, Ngozi Ezeonu and Funke Akindele. Lately, it is doing ‘Demo washes’ as part of its Ultimate Showdown campaign, but it looks as if the train has left the station. Omo may be beating its chest at the comfort of having survived the vagaries of the tempestuous Nigerian market for over 50 years when some of its peers have pegged off but what is a boxer without his punch?
