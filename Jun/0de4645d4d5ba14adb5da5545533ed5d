 By KUNLE IDOWU, Abeokuta High ranking civil servants in Ogun State have commenced serious lobby to occupy vacant Permanent Secretaries seats in the state. This is coming as politicians in the state are also approaching their godfathers to nominate them for commissionership and other political positions in the state. This is coming few weeks after those holding sway had been sent packing by the state governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun. It would be recalled that recently some of the serving Permanent Secretaries in the employ of the state government were said to have been asked to leave for either, involving in politics or for statutory reasons based on the civil service rules. It was reliably gathered that currently no fewer than 15 Permanent Secretary positions are now vacant in the state, resulting in serious lobby by serving Directors in the state Civil Service to be appointed. Hallmark was informed that the lobbyists, in their scores have resorted to sending emissaries to the head of civil service, Mrs. Modupe Adekunle for possible assistance whenever the selection process begins. Findings showed that the Directors, who are not leaving any stone unturned in their bid, have resorted to approaching traditional rulers in their areas to help them influence their appointment by the governor. The development is coming just as Hallmark learnt that the state government may have started compiling names of civil servants to be considered for the plum jobs.
