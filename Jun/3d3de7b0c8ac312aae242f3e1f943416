Bamidele Bamike | The Leader of Niger Delta Volunteers Force, Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, has thrown his weight to the agitation of the leader of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike.  Dokubo-Asari gave his support to Uwazurike, describing the agitation as justifiable in a chat with journalists in Owerri. He said, “The agitation of Niger Delta and MASSOB is an agitation for self determination. There is no difference between the vision of Niger Delta People Volunteer Force and Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra. I say this because the demand of the Niger Delta and Biafra is a demand for self determination.”  The ex-Niger Delta warlord said he remained inseparable from the MASSOB leader, explaining that the duo belonged to the Ijaw cultural group, Egbesu and that he visited Uwazuruike regularly to brainstorm on issues of regional interest.  He stated that Uwazuruike was the first non-Ijaw man,  at his instance, to be initiated into the shrine of Egbesu. Egbesu shrine is the pride of every Ijaw man. “When my people opposed his being taken to the Egbesu shrine for initiation as it is against the law of the land, I insisted that he should be taken to the shrine for initiation. With that initiation, he is an Ijaw man,” he said of Uwazuirike.  He said he insisted on the MASSOB leader’s initiation because he shared the same vision with Uwazuruike, who he said, was “fighting for the fate of his people.”
