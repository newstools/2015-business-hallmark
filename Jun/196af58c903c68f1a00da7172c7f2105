He said that the call becomes imperative in order to unite Nigerians as well as to foster peace among the diverse ethnic, religious, and political groups for the overall development of the country. He also called on Christians and others Nigerians to love their neighbours as they love themselves in the interest of peace and national development. “This ministry was formed with the aim of correcting certain ills not only among Christians of various denominations but also to preach peace to Nigerians because no society or nation experiences speedy development without peace. “Peace is paramount and non-negotiable in any society. I want to call on you and other Nigerians to avoid negative acts capable of tarnishing your image and the image of the country at large for the benefit of all. “I want to use this medium to appeal to our President, Muhammadu Buhari and other leaders to lead Nigerians righteously and with the fear of God in the interest of peace and national development,” he said. According to him “If President Muhammadu Buhari and other leaders will lead Nigerians with the fear of God, this would go a long way in uniting Nigerians as well as take the country to the greater height. He called on Nigerians to continue to pray for President Buhari and other leaders to enable them succeed in initiating peoples oriented projects in order to fight poverty, unemployment and others social vices in the country.
