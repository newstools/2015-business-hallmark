 Yinka Lawal | The National Examination Council (NECO) has warned candidates sitting for its examinations against patronizing people who post requests online, asking them to pay and get leaked answers. NECO’s Abuja Liaison Officer, Mr Abdul Mustapha said such online postings were from scammers. NECO organises Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE), Basic Education Certification Examination (BECE) and National Common Entrance Examination (NCEE). According to Mustapha, such fraudsters cheat unsuspecting candidates, adding that whoever patronises them does so at his/her peril. “They have no access to our answers; they cannot get our answers; they will pretend as if they have seen the answers but it is all lies. “Our questions appear in four types – types A to D ; but what they present to unsuspecting candidates is just manufactured answers without the type specifications. “Again, our questions stop at 50, but theirs continue from 51 to 100; that is another proof that they have not seen our answers. “In one occasion, in our biology exam, the specimen was an ear but they drew flower in their own fake answers,’’ he said. He said that candidates had always shy from reporting to NECO when they fell prey to scammers, ‘’knowing that they tried to cheat but ended up being cheated.’’ The 2015 NECO SSCE internal examination which commenced on May 21 will end on July 10.
