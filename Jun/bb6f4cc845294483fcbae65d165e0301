Super Eagles coach, Stephen Keshi has stated that he will continue to experiment with the national team as the Eagles chase qualification for the 2017 African Cup of Nations. Nigerian fans watched as the Super Eagles laboured to a 2-0 win over Chad last Saturday. Four new faces were introduced to the team by coach Keshi. He argued that this process will continue as he seeks to achieve a balance in his squad. “Even if you’ve had a team for five or six years, you will still have one or two additions or subtractions to make in your team because we’re always looking for that balance,” he said. “Against Chad I had several new faces and they are players I have been studying for some time. I know their quality and if we had time, long enough to work together it would have been different from what we saw against Chad. “We have to do what we have to do to find a very solid team and I have confidence in this group of players because there is a lot of potential and we have to keep giving them more opportunities,” Keshi said. However, football administrator, Ahmed Garra Gombe has stated that Keshi was heading for another failure, if he continued with what Gombe termed as his uncoordinated approach to the Eagles job. “With the way Keshi is going, I am afraid we are headed for another failure. “Look at the last match that was played. What was the pattern? Did it look like a team that has a mission?”
