 Some of the Chibok girls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Borno State have been brainwashed into killing and torturing the terror group’s other prisoners, Amnesty International has revealed. According to Amnesty International, other women who were captured by the Islamist group claim they were held in the same camp as some of the kidnapped schoolgirls are now carrying out killings on behalf of their captors. The group said that it is aware that out of the 276 girls abducted from their boarding school by the Islamist groups more than a year ago, some of 219 still missing have been forced to fight for Boko Haram. One 17-year-old witness said that after she was captured by Boko Haram, she was told she would become the wife of one of the militants. When she refused, they slit the throats of four men in front of her – and said she would suffer the same fate if she did not cooperate. The teenager went on to marry a Boko Haram member, was repeatedly raped and is now pregnant with his child. She said some of the Chilbok schoolgirls were held in the same camp as her, and they urged her to comply with their terrorist captors – and killed Christian men in front of her. “They were Christian men. They (Boko Haram fighters) forced the Christians to lie down. Then the girls cut their throats”, the unidentified teen told Amnesty International.
