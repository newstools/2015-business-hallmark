Members House of Representatives turned the legislative chambers to boxing ring this morning as they threw blows on themselves over election of majority leaders and other key positions. The brawl disrupted the  plenary session as the two factions protested vehemently . Following the crisis, the Mace was quickly taken away to the inner office of the Speaker, Yakubu Dogara. Confusion currently prevails in the Green Chamber, with no one appearing to be in charge. Some loyalists surround the Speaker, with each of them trying to tell Dogara what to do in the midst of the confusion in the House.
