Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday quizzed former governor of Ebonyi State, Martin Elechi, over alleged financial misdeeds during his tenure in office. A credible source at the commission’s headquarters told Daily Sun that the former governor arrived in Abuja at about 10am to honour the agency’s invitation. The source said Elechi was asked to render account of his management of the funds of the state for eight years. At press time yesterday, it could not be confirmed whether the former governor would be granted administrative bail or be detained by the commission. Contacted, the EFCC spokesman, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed that Elechi was being questioned over alleged financial recklessness. He, however, declined to confirm whether the former governor would be detained.
