Kunle Awosiyan | Wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari has said that his husband Mohammadu Buhari will run an open government where no one will be asked to pay money to see him. She said this during an “Appreciation Dinner” she hosted in honour of the All Progressives Congress’ women and youths at the old Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Sunday. She said, “Government under my husband will be run differently from what was obtainable under Jonathan when people were allegedly asked to be paying huge amount of money in foreign currency before they could see the President or his wife.” “I will like to inform you that in the past regime, whether it is true or false, only God knows, some people were going round and parading themselves as personal assistants. If you wanted to see the President’s wife, you will pay $30,000 or $50,000 and if you are seeing the President, you will pay all that you have saved in your lifetime. “This will not happen in our regime. Whoever asks you to give a single penny in the name of coming to see the President or his wife is not our (member of) staff. He is not an APC member, it is a lie. Don’t be deceived,” she said. Buhari implored politicians who might eventually be working with the president to be careful the way they carry themselves, adding, “We are praying and hoping that people around him should know that it took him 12 years to get to that position and they must know that they are coming to serve the masses, not General Buhari. It is the people that are around him that will determine the political health of our state.”
