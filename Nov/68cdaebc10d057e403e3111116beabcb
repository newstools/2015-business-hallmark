Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has called on commercial banks to partner with the Muhammadu Buhari led federal government to effectively tackle corruption. Addressing a Fidelity Bank Plc management team led by managing director and chief executive officer, Mr. Nnamdi Okonkwo, Saraki said the banks must play a role in knowing the customers, and be ready to be accountable for the activites if their customers“In developed societies, banks know that if their customers are being questioned in any activity. They too are responsible for either not bringing it to the attention of the government because there is nothing that happens that does not go through the banking system. “So, if the banking system is tight, it will bring the greatest contribution in fighting corruption even more than anywhere else because at the end of the day, it must come through the banking system,” he said. He told the Fidelity Bank team who visited him at the National Assembly last weekend stressed that banks are at a vantage position to disclose suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities. He argued that when a turns a blind eye, saying ‘it is not our business,’ that does not help. “I think we need to start looking at that in supporting the government in addressing this area,” he said. He further urged banks to ensure that they lend needed support to farmers in order to boost food production and stimulate the growth of agriculture in the country. On his part, Mr, Okonkwo told the Senate President that the visit was in line with the bank’s ongoing engagement with critical stakeholders in the economy. He added that Fidelity Bank has been and would continue to provide support for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs), industries and telecommunication sectors in order to grow the economy.
