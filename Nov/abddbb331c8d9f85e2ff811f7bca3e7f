The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) said it had degraded Boko Haram terrorists’ logistics, vehicle workshop and a weapon storage facility after successful interdiction missions on their Sambisa forest hideout. Air Commodore Isiaka Amao, the Air Component Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole, said this while briefing newsmen in Maiduguri on Thursday. Amao said that NAF had also destroyed a bomb making factory in the forest. “The Air Component has continued to intensify its air effort in support of the ground troops. In October, over 40 interdiction missions with over 80 percent success were carried out. “Just to mention a few, we have in the month degraded the terrorists’ logistics in the Sambisa forest,” he said. Amao said that NAF had also destroyed two suspected terrorists’ camps in the forest. “The continued air strikes have significantly degraded the capabilities of the terrorists. “Likewise, two terrorists’ hideouts in Sambisa were destroyed,” he said. Amao, however, announced that NAF lost one of its pilot, Flight Lt. Ebitimi Owei, during the month. “On a sad note we lost a colleague, Flight Lt. Ebitimi Owei, and a platform during one of the missions. “May his gentle soul rest in peace,” he said. Amao said that the death of Owei will not affect the morale of officers engaged in the operation. He said that NAF also intercepted and destroyed a boat carrying fuel to the terrorists along Nigeria- Cameroon border. “The Air Component also struck a mass gathering of Boko Haram terrorists and some leadership at Wulge. “Report received after the strike was that it was a huge success as many terrorists were killed,” Amao said. He said that NAF also sighted and neutralised terrorists’ vehicles in Kunshe town. “Other armed missions were carried out in Geidam, Gamboru, Ngala, Mafa, Kirenowa and Banki towns, among others. “These missions were aimed at identifying and destroying opportunity targets and denying terrorists freedom of action,” Amao said.
