Lagos State government has alerted the public to the dangers of consuming contaminated poultry products like chickens and turkeys currently in circulation in the state. According to the state Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Toyin Suarau, some unscrupulous individuals exhumed imported contaminated poultry products seized and destroyed by men of the Nigeria Customs Service in Badagry with the intent to sell same to unsuspecting consumers. Suarau, who made the disclosure recently in Lagos, revealed that the imported poultry products were preserved with chemicals like formalin which is poisonous, as it could lead to slow death without the knowledge of the consumer. Suarau explained the state government was spurred by the implication of the development on lives of its residents to alert the public. “We are much more concern about the implications of consuming unwholesome poultry produce, we cannot toil with the lives of over 21million Lagosians and that is why as part of our proactive measures the ministry will liaise with all its field officers to pass the information across the state” he stated. The commissioner while reiterating the state government’s commitment towards ensuring food security for residents of Lagos vowed that the state government will not relent in its quest to improve the quality of life of citizens, adding that health and wellbeing of residents is cardinal in the policy thrust of government.
