The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has slammed a N1 billion administrative charge fine on beverage maker, Guinness Nigeria Plc., over infractions related to the use of expired raw materials for its beverages. NAFDAC’s findings during an inspection of the company’s facility in Ikeja, Lagos, revealed the poor conditions under which raw materials used in production were being kept. Guinness Nigeria, a subsidiary of Diageo Plc., United Kingdom, in a statement said it is in talks with the food, drug and beverage regulator over the administrative charges and alleged infringement with a view to gaining better clarity on the issue.
