Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State will on December 15 host a Town Hall Meeting on security, a statement by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF), said on Tuesday. The statement, signed by the Executive Secretary of the LSSTF, Dr Abdurrazaq Balogun, said it would provide an avenue for the governor to share his ideas on security. Balogun said that the governor would also get feedback from decision makers and stakeholders at the forum which is organised by the LSSTF. He said that the state Commissioner of Police would also present the security report of the state to the public. Balogun said that the meeting, which is the first under the present administration and the 9th in the series, would afford Ambode opportunity to render account of the Trust Fund. He said the governor would also be able to present the audit report and solicit for more donations to the fund. Balogun said that this was in compliance with the duty of the fund, accounting to the public on its activities. According to him, recognition of outstanding security operatives and other stakeholders are also done at such Town Hall meetings. (NAN)
