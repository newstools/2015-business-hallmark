The Court of Appeal has affirmed the judgment of the Rivers Governorship Election Tribunal. The court said on Wednesday that Nyesom Wike, the governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in this year’s election, was not validly elected. The Rivers tribunal had earlier on October 24 nullified Mr. Wike’s election. The tribunal, which delivered its ruling in Abuja, also ordered that a fresh governorship election be conducted in the state. After the tribunal’s ruling, the governor headed to the Court of Appeal, saying the judgment was untenable. The petition challenging the election of Mr. Wike as Rivers State governor was filed by Dakuku Peterside, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, in the election. The Rivers governorship election, which was criticised by local and international observers, witnessed the largest amount of violence both in its build-up and after the elections. Mr. Wike said he is heading to Supreme Court.
