Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has appointed 15 additional Special Advisers (SAs), bringing the number to about 25 SAs. The governor has equally assured the people of the state of sustained developmental programmes that would further enhance their living conditions.
Wike, who swore in the 15 Special Advisers at the Government House, Port Harcourt on Saturday, December 26, urged the new aides to join in implementation of the development agenda of the state; reminding them that they were appointed to contribute their own quota to the growth of the state.
The governor told the special advisers not to see their appointments as an opportunity to make money, but rather a privilege to serve the state.
He said: “Your appointments should be seen as an opportunity to serve the state and contribute your own quota. If you have joined this administration to make money, then you will be disappointed. There is no money to be made. You can only serve the state.”
In an interview  after the inauguration, Deima Iyalla, one of the Special Advisers, assured the people of the state that the new advisers would live up to their expectations.
Earlier on December 18, Governor Wike swore in six SAs along with 22 commissioners, in what he had described as a full fledged cabinet ready to bring about good governance in the state.
