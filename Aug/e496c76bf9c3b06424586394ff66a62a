KUNLE IDOWU, Abeokuta The body of a 23-year-old lady has been dumped at a dumpsite at the Olomoore junction in Abeokuta metropolis, Ogun State, with some parts of the body already removed. The victim’s name was given as Sitira, and said to be an apprentice hairdresser. Before her tragic death, she was said to have completed her apprenticeship and was preparing for her ‘freedom’ (graduation). Some residents of the area believed that she was a victim of ritualists. It was gathered that Sitira’s corpse was allegedly thrown off a moving jeep at the Olomoore dumpsite located along the Abeokuta-Lagos Expressway in the early hours of Sunday. Littering the site were ladies pants, brassieres, camisoles, lip sticks, powder kits, and nail-paint, which suggested Sitira might not have been the only victim. Some metres away from the spot, where these items were seen, lay the half-clothed Sitira’s corpse, with her camisole and ‘leggings’ intact. But close observation of her corpse revealed that substantial flesh from her right arm was cut off, with body fluid oozing out. Meanwhile, a middle aged woman, Esther Adewuyi, who identified herself as a relative of Sitira, spoke with journalists amidst sobbing. She said the 23-year-old lady, who lost her only child two years ago, had been living with her mother in the Iberekodo area of Abeokuta North Local Government Area. “Sitira was a hair stylist apprentice and she was last seen in their house around 10p.m on Saturday night where she and her mother discussed plans for her ‘freedom’. Nobody, including her younger siblings, knew when she went out,” Adewuyi said. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, confirmed that Sitira must have been killed and dumped at the site. “We found the corpse in the area but we have taken the corpse to the mortuary.”
