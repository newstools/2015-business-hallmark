  A new chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is expected to emerge in September, following the expiration of the tenure of the acting chairman, Chief Uche Secondus, who is expected to revert to his former status as deputy national chairman. It was learnt that no fewer than 20 candidates from the North-East zone were jostling to become the PDP boss. The Convener of the Restart PDP Project Committee, Nwosu Butches, who said this at a press conference on Wednesday in Abuja, called on the zone to present credible candidates that could pilot the party to a stronger level. He expressed confidence that the party would  present a national chairman that will have “the appeal that is needed at this point in time which is credibility and  strong character and the goodwill that Nigerians will rely on to give PDP back a chance at governance.” He explained that from September, the committee would begin wider consultations with critical stakeholders, including and most especially the G34 founding fathers. The essence of this, Butches added, is to draw from their original plan in a bid to restructure the PDP. “In a few days’ time, the tenure of the present acting national chairman of our national party will be over. He is acting as the constitution of our party stipulated for a short period when the zone that created the vacancy will present another candidate for the chairmanship. “We want to also call on the North-East Zone that is supposed to present a candidate who will complete the tenure up to March of this incumbent NWC, to make sure they do their homework and give the party a very credible candidate, a candidate with character, a candidate with the appeal that Nigerians will see and know this is a rebranded PDP.” According to him, the blueprint for the restructuring of the PDP had been presented to the founding fathers who he said, had endorsed the roadmap.
