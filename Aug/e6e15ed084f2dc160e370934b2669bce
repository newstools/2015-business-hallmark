The joint security taskforce in Anambra State yesterday commenced the enforcement of crash helmets for motorcycle riders in the state. The exercise, which was launched in Nnewi, is tagged ‘Operation No Mercy’. The exercise, which is led by the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) is being enforced by the army, the police, civil defence, NDLEA, Man-O-War, peace corps and boys’ scouts. The FRSC Sector Commander, Mr Sunday Ajayi, said that the exercise was ordered by Governor Willie Obiano. Ajayi noted that the use of crash helmets by motorcyclists and their passengers was one of the measures to check incidences of motorcycle crashes. “Apart from restricting motorcycles from plying major roads in the state, the governor as well ordered that everybody on top of a bike, whether commercial or private, must wear a crash helmet. “This is part of the governor’s commitment to make Anambra safe for all. And the government wants to stop spending its limited resources on motorcycle accident victims’ emergency wards in the hospitals,’’ he said. The FRSC boss advised motorcycle riders and users to comply so that their bikes would not be impounded. He said that whoever was not comfortable with a crash helmet as a passenger could first put a handkerchief or nylon on their heads. “On the other hand, if you are accustomed to patronising ‘okada’ riders, you might as well buy your private crash helmet to use anytime you are moving around,” he added. Ajayi, who noted that the taskforce would strictly carry out the directive, added that the earlier motorcycle riders complied, the better for them. Obiano had vowed to take drastic steps to reduce road accidents in the state following the loss of 69 lives during the May 31 petrol tanker crash.
