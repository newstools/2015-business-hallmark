The Kogi PDP Elders Advisory Council has endorsed the state governor, Capt. Idris Wada, for a second term in office.
Alhaji Ibrahim Idris, chairman of the council, announced the decision at a news briefing on Monday in Lokoja.
Idris, who is also the immediate past governor of the state, said that the elders have also resolved to allow Kogi West or Kogi Central to produce the next governorship candidate of the party in 2019.
According to him, the elders and some critical stakeholders in the party from across the state took the decision at a meeting held in Lokoja on August 16.
According to him, the elders supported Wadaâ€™s candidature because of his good performance and quality leadership.
