 The United States Government has pledged its readiness to work with the new management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in achieving the Federal Government’s reform agenda in the oil and gas industry. Speaking during a courtesy call on the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, at the corporation’s headquarter in Abuja, Thursday,  the U. S Ambassador to Nigeria, Amb. James Entwistle, said his country is willing to provide all necessary support to the new NNPC management to realize its goals and objectives. The Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of NNPC, Mr. Ohi Alegbe, made this known in a statement on Thursday. Entwistle noted that although the job of the GMD of NNPC is about the most challenging job in Nigeria, the U.S is convinced that Dr. Kachikwu has the skills, training and requisite experience to lead the oil and gas industry in Nigeria towards the path of growth and sustainable development. Commending the U.S for the pledge of support, Dr. Kachikwu reiterated the determination of the new management to implement President Muhammadu Buhari’s reform agenda in the petroleum industry.
