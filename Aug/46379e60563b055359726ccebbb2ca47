At least 40 people were killed on Tuesday when an explosion occurred at the cow section of Sabon Gari market in Damboa Local Government Area of Borno State. A source said that the incident occurred around 1p.m. “It was a bloody attack by a female suicide bomber and apart from the over 40 people who were killed, many sustained injuries. “I don’t know the number of those injured but rescue workers have taken over the market.” A member of a civilian vigilante group, Umar Kidda, told newsmen that more than “47 dead persons have been removed from the market”. Kidda, who said he witnessed bodies being taken away, said the market was busy when the explosion occurred. A military source who declined to be named, also disclosed that around 50 people had been killed. There has hardly been any week that the insurgents have not struck since May 29 when Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in as president.
