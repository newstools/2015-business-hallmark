 The Senate Minority Leader, Godswill Akpabio, has lamented the worsening state of the country’s power sector. Speaking in support of a motion moved by Senate Majority Leader, Ali Ndume, regarding the disconnection of Maiduguri from the national grid and general power generation in Nigeria,‎ Akpabio said the oil producing states in Nigeria contributed about $5.1 billion to the development of the power sector in 2011, but nothing tangible came out of that gesture. “In 2011, when I was governor, those of us from the oil producing states decided to forgo‎ about $5.1 billion to the federal government for the development of electricity. But it is sad today we are still where we are, and celebrating the generation of only 4, 600 megawatts,” he said. Akpabio expressed sadness over the closure of businesses in the country owing to electricity challenges, urging the senate to adopt a definite and holistic approach to solving the problem instead of always “looking at the government (executive).” After a brief debate on Ndume’s motion, the senate directed the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to immediately reconnect Maiduguri to the national grid. It also set up an ad-hoc committee on power to carry out a holistic investigation on the management of funds appropriated to the power sector since 1999, and the unbundling of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN). Chaired by Abubakar Kiri (Borno north), the committee was given four weeks to submit its report. Olusola Adeyeye (Osun), Dino Melaye (Kogi) and Akpabio are members of the committee.
