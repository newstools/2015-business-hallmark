 Former governor of Ogun State and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Otunba Gbanga Daniel has described Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka as a self styled social critic who needs our prayers. He made this statement in reaction to comments credited to Soyinka in his interview with Zero Tolerance, a publication of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. In a statement issued by Daniel, he said “we have read with disappointment and mixed feelings some of the uncharitable statements credited to the Nobel Laureate Professor Wole Soyinka in Zero Tolerance, a publication of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). In the said interview, we noticed what has now become character about the respected literary icon, the disparaging reference to Otunba Gbenga Daniel, former Governor of Ogun State. We need to state unequivocally that we are disappointed because by training, conduct and culture, a younger man is disadvantaged to respond to elders in this part of the world, and we relate to this statement with mixed feelings because, Professor Soyinka is somebody Otunba Gbenga Daniel holds in high esteem as a great Ambassador of Africa, part of the reason why his 70th birthday was celebrated with pomp and ceremony during the administration of Otunba Daniel. However we need to set certain records straight on some of the issues so that the unsuspecting publics would not continue to be misled and misguided by the misrepresentation of facts on our recent history especially coming from someone of Professor Soyinka’s standing. We implore those who have been so misguided by the orchestrated falsehood, lies and deceits and misrepresentations spurned out to encourage Professor Soyinka to do critical review of the performances of some of the governments and political actors he had promoted, supported and helped installed in relation to the commonwealth and improvements of the living conditions of the average citizens.
