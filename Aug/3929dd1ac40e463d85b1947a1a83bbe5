 The immediate past National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki, was on Monday charged to court by the Department of State Services (DSS). A statement on Monday by the Acting spokesman of the DSS, Tony Opuiyo, said Dasuki was charged to court based on evidence relating to possession of fire arms without license. According to the statement, the offence is punishable under Section 27(i) (a) (i) of the Firearms Act Cap F28LFN 2004. “This is in line with democratic practice and our avowed commitment to the rule of law, in which nobody is deemed to be above the law, no matter how highly placed in the society. “Accordingly, the general public will be duly informed as the matter progresses”, the statement added. The DSS had, on July 16, 2015, carried out a search operation on properties belonging to Dasuki in Abuja and Sokoto. The search operation followed what the DSS described as credible intelligence linking the ex NSA him to acts capable of undermining national security. “The search led to the recovery of large cache of arms and ammunition among other things and for which further investigation was conducted”, the DSS said.
