 PETER OKORE, Umuahia When the Abia State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal reconvened, Monday, for further hearing in the consolidated petition filed by the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance(APGA), Dr. Alex Otti, challenging the results of Ugwunagbo, Isialangwa- North, Obingwa, Osisioma and Umuahia- North Local Government Areas, it overruled the objections of the three respondents against the admissibility of some units results of Ugwunagbo Ward 1 in the April 2015 general elections in the state.
Counsel for Otti, Prof. Awa Kalu (SAN), who tendered the results, contended that they were duly certified in full compliance with Section 104 of the Evidence Act and the tribunal’s directive on Friday, August 13.
But, Chief Wole Olanikpeku (SAN), Dr. Onyechi Ikpeazu (SAN) and Dr. Livy Uzoukwu (SAN), counsels for Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu, the Peoples Democratic Party and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) respectively, objected to their admissibility.
They argued that the result sheets were not properly and duly certified in compliance to Section 104 of the Evidence Act and urged the tribunal to throw it away.
The respondents also objected to the admissibility of the unit results from Isialangwa -North, Umuahia- North and remaining units from Ugwunagbo LGAs, which were also tendered from the bar by counsel to the petitioners (Otti and APGA).
They said their grounds of objection and argument would be incorporated in their final written addresses in-line with the agreement reached with the petitioner’s counsel.
In his ruling, the tribunal Chairman, Justice Usman Bwala, overruled the objection, saying that the document was certified in compliance with Section 104 of the Evidence Act and the tribunal’s prescription.
Bwala therefore admitted the document and marked it as Exhibit PB01A-A6.
Hearing in the petition continues the next day.
