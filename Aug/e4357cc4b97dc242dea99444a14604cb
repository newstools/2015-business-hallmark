 The Senate on Thursday commissioned a panel to conduct a holistic investigation into management of funds allocated to the power sector since 1999. The ad-hoc committee is also mandated to look into the unbundling of Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN). The 13-man committee that will look at irregularities in the power sector is headed by Senator Abubakar Kyari (Borno North). It is expected to conclude its investigation and report back to the Senate within four weeks. This followed the adoption of a motion on ‘The Disconnection of Maiduguri from the National Grid and General Power Degeneration in Nigeria,’ sponsored by the leader of the Senate, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume. Other members of the committee are Senators Godswill Akpabio, Babajide Omoworare, Mohammed Hassan, Ali Wakili, Mao Ohuabunwa, Aliyu Magatakarda  Wamakko , Olusola Adeyeye and Mohammed Shaaba Lafiagi. The Senate urged President Muhammadu Buhari to mandate the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to immediately reconnect Maiduguri back to the national grid. The lawmakers also urged the Federal Government to complete the Mambilla Power Project to improve electricity supply in the country. They condemned the inability of TCN to provide regular and uninterrupted power supply to all parts of the country. Ndume expressed worry that Nigeria with a population of over 150 million produces only 4, 600 megawatts of electricity, while South Africa with a population of about 40 million people produces 40,000 megawatts.
