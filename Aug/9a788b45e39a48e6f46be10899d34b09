 President Mohammadu Buhari has ordered the Ministry of Aviation to expedite action on the establishment of a new national airline for the country. The President gave the directive yesterday while receiving briefings from officials of the Aviation Ministry, led by the Permanent Secretary, Binta Bello, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Speaking with State House correspondents after the briefing, Bello said the President was worried about Nigeria not having a national air carrier and has given instructions for a new one to be established. She also said the President was briefed on the challenges domestic airlines were facing despite the federal governmentâ€™s N300 billion intervention fund designed to boost their operations. The airlines, she said, were hugely indebted to regulatory agencies under the Aviation Ministry, including other factors that have left some of the airlines still struggling to maintain optimum operational capabilities. According to her, the four state-of-the-art terminals being constructed with a Chinese Bank loan will be ready by the first quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, President Buhari has sacked all the Group Executive Directors (GEDs) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) with immediate effect. This is happening barely a day after the president appointed Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu as the Group Managing Director of the NNPC. The affected GEDs were appointed by former President Goodluck Jonathan in March 2014. The GEDs, who were fired, are Mr. Ian Udoh in charge of Refining and Petrochemicals, Mr. Adebayo Ibirogba heading the Engineering and Technical team, Dr. David Ige, leading Gas and Power, Dr. Attahir Yusuf, leading Business Development; Dr. Dan Efebo, leading Corporate Services, Mr. Bernard Otti, in charge of Finance and Accounts and Ms. Aisha Abdurrahman, leading Commerce and Investments. It was also gathered that GMD Kachikwu intends to reduce the number of GEDs from nine to four.
