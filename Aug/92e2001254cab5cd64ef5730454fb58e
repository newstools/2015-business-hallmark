According to residents in his Oko-Oba area, Baba Ibeji was fond of chasing women. They noted that he divorces and gets married almost every two years. The victim, who was a landlord in his area, was found dead in a hotel room in Oko-Oba some hours after he booked in with the woman whose family used to live in his house. It was revealed that Baba Ibeji was caught sleeping with the woman prompting the husband of the woman to pack her load from the house. Speaking with journalists at the hotel, one of the bar men who was on duty when the incident occurred explained that the victim was a regular customer of the hotel, adding that he (Baba Ibeji) always visits the hotel with different women. “On the day of the incident, he came in with the woman and paid for three hours but after about an hour, we heard the woman’s screaming and we rushed to the room to find the man on the floor, gasping for breath. We tried to administer first aid on him while our manager tried to get a taxi to get him to the hospital but he died right there. The police was called in and his corpse was taken away while the woman was arrested”, said the bar man.
