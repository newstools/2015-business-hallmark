The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is appropriating the achievements of the Goodluck Jonathan administration and taking glory for them. The party stated that instead of taking the glory for its achievements, “the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari should make haste and activate the various economic outlets which have been stagnated as a result of their obvious inability to articulate a clear-cut economic policy for the nation”. Speaking through its National Publicity Secretary, Olisa Metuh, PDP said “it was disappointing that a government which came to power on claims of high moral ground, rather than focusing on delivering its promises, is dancing around the achievements of the previous government in an attempt to make the public believe that recorded successes in critical sectors are theirs”. “For instance, how do we explain APC’s spirited effort to make the public believe that the equipping of the country’s military for the fights against insurgency, the turnaround of the nation’s oil refineries; and the polio-free certification of Nigeria were products of their government even when it is common knowledge that they have not been able to find their bearing for governance since their election into office,” the party said. “If the former national security adviser (NSA), Col. Sambo Dasuki had not been courageous enough to release those incontrovertible facts that the Goodluck Jonathan-led PDP administration actually fortified the country’s military before leaving office in May, the APC would have succeeded in its propaganda against that administration and led Nigerians to believe that the equipping was a product of President Buhari’s recent diplomatic shuttles. “It is an obvious fact that before the May 29 handover to the APC, the Nigerian armed forces, using these equipment sourced under the watch of the PDP government, had already pushed the insurgents to the verge of surrender in the Sambisa forest, only for them to now recover under the APC-led government due to apparent lack of direction and confusion that have characterised this administration. “In the same way, this government has positioned itself to claim credit for the turnaround and resuscitation of some of the nation’s oil refineries without reference to the past administration that initiated and executed the turnaround maintenance (TAM) of the facilities years back, which dividends the nation now enjoys and which we expect will result in steady supply of petroleum products in our nation. “Similarly, informed Nigerians note with dismay how the APC administration has been celebrating the certification of Nigeria as polio-free in the last one year by the World Health Organization (WHO) without giving credit to the PDP-led government under whose watch the feat was achieved. “While the PDP well understands the nervousness of the APC and its government in the challenge of fulfilling their bogus promises upon which they rode to power, such does not in any way rationalise the resort to deceit and flagrant appropriation of another’s achievements, a thing no serious, credible and honest government will do.” It added that instead of trying “to poach achievements to earn an undeserved praise, the APC and its government should brace up, articulate a precise economic policy, assemble an economic team and urgently commence the delivery of their promises for which they were voted.” The PDP said it found it unacceptable, notwithstanding the reasons being adduced, for a government in a democratic setting to run for almost three months without a cabinet and any policy direction whatsoever.
