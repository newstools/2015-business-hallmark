The Federal Government on Thursday appointed international audit firms, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), to conduct comprehensive audit of the accounts of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and other revenue generating agencies. The appointment was disclosed to State House correspondents by Edo State governor, Adams Oshiomhole, at the end of the second meeting of the four-man panel set up by the National Economic Council (NEC). The decision to appoint the two audit firms, he said, was taken to allow for professionalism.
