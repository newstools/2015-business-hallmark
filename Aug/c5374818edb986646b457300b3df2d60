Nigeria’s women sprints champion, Blessing Okagbare, on Monday in Beijing, China at the 15th IAAF World Championships finished 8th in the 100 metres final. It was, however, a different story for teammate Patience George as she qualified for Tuesday’s semi-finals in the women’s 400m, even though two other compatriots failed to advance. Okagbare, who had earlier in the day in the semi-finals ran 10.89 seconds to place second on from lane four, was on lane 9 and could only clock 11.02 seconds. She had on Sunday placed first in heat two with 11.07 seconds, and her semi-final showing had raised hopes of a medal prospect, especially as her season best is 10.80 seconds. In the quarter-mile, George whose season best is 50.76 seconds will compete in heat two on Tuesday from lane 8 after she finished third in heat 5 in 50.87 seconds. Compatriot Regina George, whose season best was 51.30 seconds and personal best 50.84 seconds, ran in at 51.74 seconds to place fourth in heat 4 and miss out on qualification for the semis. Tosin Adeloye also failed to qualify from heat 2, after placing fifth with 52.42 seconds, in spite of a season and personal best 51.92 seconds. The Athletics World Championships which is holding at Beijing’s National Stadium began on Saturday and will end on Sunday. (NAN)
