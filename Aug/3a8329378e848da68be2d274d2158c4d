  A fake Islamic cleric has been arraigned before Isolo Magistrate Court for having fake sex deliverance with 34-year-old lady for three days. The fake cleric, Jamiu Mukaila, 42, was alleged to have defrauded the lady, Bose Alele, with N350, 000 after which he engaged her in a three-day marathon sex under the false pretence of casting evil spirit out of her. The incident happened in her house at Ire-Akari Road in Isolo, a suburb of Lagos. The victim explained that Mukaila approached her and introduced himself as Alfa and told her that he had a revelation from God concerning making her life better. She added that Mukaila told her that she was possessed by evil spirit and that she needed deliverance to cast out the evil spirit so that favour will come her way. Alele revealed further that part of the condition he gave her was that she would pay N350, 000 which would be used to buy spiritual materials and that she must sleep with him for three days. She said he assured her that she would enjoy favours after he had worked on her and that she would equally get a husband of her choice after the deliverance. “I did not know what came over me immediately after the encounter. I quickly paid the N350, 000 he requested and also allowed him have sex with me for three days before I came to my senses”, said Alele. “Immediately I realised that I had fallen for the cleric’s deception, I went to Aswani Police Division and reported what happened”, said Alele. Mukaila was arrested and taken to the station where he confessed to committing the crimes. He claimed that he was born into an Alfa family and inherited the gift of prophecy and deliverance. Inspector Abas Abayomi, who is the police prosecutor of the case, charged the cleric to court with stealing and obtaining sex under false pretence. The suspect, however, pleaded not guilty. He was later granted bail in the sum of N100, 000 with two sureties.
