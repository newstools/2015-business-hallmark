Nobody can function well or for a long time with a damaged brain. And this was what happened to comic actor and creator of ”Crack Ya Ribs” platform, Julius Agwu recently! Not many people knew about it anyway. But right now. the Choba, Rivers State-born struggler who started as an actor and later music-comedian, is thanking God with his entire family and associates for His mercies. A Houston, USA-based hospital cured as the Lord healed! Unmistakably one of the most successful acts in the industry, Julius suffered brain tumor which sidelined him for some time and had to undergo surgery before getting on his feet again. Expectedly, he gives a greater percentage of his survival credit to his wife, and if you’ve read and listened well, you must have noticed that he is truly on the march again. The next edition of ”Crack Ya Ribs” is slated for London soon! ”Happy Recover” from this angle, apologies to Sir Shina Peters!
