The Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company (KRPC) says the Federal Government will save over $5.33 million from fuel importation when the company hits 90 percent production in 2016. This is contained in the KRPC production report made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Kaduna. In the report, KRPC said that at 90 percent production capacity, it would be able to release about five million litres of fuel products into the market. According to the company, this will address the supply shortage in the northern region. The company had announced that it would hit 90 percent production capacity in March 2016 on completion of the on-going Turn-Around Maintenance (TAM), which began in October 2014. KRPC, which has 110,000 barrels per day installed capacity, is currently operating at about 60 percent output with two production equipment restored after undergoing local maintenance. The company said it would release about five million litres of locally refined fuel at the end of March 2016 when the maintenance was completed, thereby cutting the cost of fuel importation by the Federal Government. A breakdown of the report indicates that government will save $1.892 million daily on importation of premium motor spirit (PMS), also known as petrol, when it hits the 90 percent production target in 2016. “At the same 90 percent output, KRPC will save $672,546 daily on importation of kerosene and $1.86 million daily on the importation of diesel. “The company will also save $176,727 daily on importation of LPG and $727,306 daily on importation of fuel oil. “These represent a total savings of $5.33 million daily for fuel products only.’’ KRPC’s Manager, Production Programming and Quality Control (PPQC), Mr Shehu Malami, had recently said that the refinery was expected to produce about 4.6 million litres of PMS at 90 percent capacity in 2016. Malami said that the company had resumed production at about 60 percent and was currently producing 3,083,100 litres. The official disclosed this in a paper, ‘KRPC Operations and Impact on the Economy,’ presented on August 8 at a two-day annual Energy Correspondents Workshop in Kano. According to him, the volume of kerosene production will rise to 1,849,500 litres at 90 percent capacity as against the current 1,233,000 litres production at 60 percent capacity. “That of diesel is to hit 3,153,600 litres at 90 percent as against 2,102,400 litres at current 60 percent capacity. “LPG will attain 486,000 litres at 90 percent from its current 324,000 litres at 60 per cent capacity among other products.’’
