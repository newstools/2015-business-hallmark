 Heritage Bank has concluded plans to become a national financial institution that will operate and render full commercial banking services across the country. This is the aftermath of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Federal High Court final approval for the merger of Heritage Bank and Enterprise Bank. The new move is the high point of transformation which saw Heritage Bank Limited acquiring the Enterprise Bank from the Asset Management Company of Nigeria, AMCOM. The Bank, which hitherto operated as a regional bank, with 15 “experience centres”, is expected to increase its presence to about 200 branches boosted by about 165 branches of Enterprise Bank, spread across the country. According to the bank, this monumental event marks a new era in banking in Nigeria as the integration of two entities with such similar values, excellent and professional staffing, strong branch network; can only lead to an entity that is poised for excellence and quality financial services. “With this acquisition, we are better positioned to offer you unparalleled banking services which spreads across over 200 branches, 177 ATMs, 57 Cash Centres and 2000 POS Terminals in 26 states. We shall harness the best of the two worlds combined in terms of our innovative products, bespoke technology and extended branch network manned by a team of tenacious people; as this automatically transforms our bank from a tier-2 player to a strong tier-1 player that is ONE! BIGGER! BETTER!,” the bank said.
