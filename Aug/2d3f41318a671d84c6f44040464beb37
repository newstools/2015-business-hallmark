  As parts of effort to coordinate the importation of petroleum products, Godwin Emefiele, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), hasrevealed that the Federal Government is working on a situation where only the Nigerian National Pe­troleum Corporation (NNPC) will import the products into the country. Emefiele, revealed this in an interview withFinancial Times of London recently,  according to him, “ President MohammaduBuhari has promised to reduce importation of petro­leum products by ensuring that our refineries work. Our refin­eries are working now, Warri and Port Harcourt have started producing, they have not ob­tained the optimal capacity but they will. Kaduna refinery will start working this month”. He added; “Now, there are other actions that the presidency is putting in place to ensure that we reduce importation of petroleum prod­ucts where the NNPC will solely, almost solely be responsible for procuring re­fined petroleum.” “Those who are importing pe­troleum products will only just need to go to the NNPC and pick up petroleum products. So in that area I would say that we are already moving in the direction of reducing the import of pe­troleum products. And we will achieve it.” Emefiele however revealed that President Buhari’sis working on way of recouping stolen oil rev­enues which he said were depos­ited in banks. According to him, CBN will also assist in drilling them once we get to that stage.
