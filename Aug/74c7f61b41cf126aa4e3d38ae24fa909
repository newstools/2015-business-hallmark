The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has commenced interrogation of Paul Orhii, director-general of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) for alleged contract scam and abuse of office.
A source at NAFDAC disclosed that the DG arrived at the Wuse, Abuja headquarters of the EFCC at about 9a.m today in response to an invitation requesting him to present himself to be interviewed by the anti-graft agency.
Although the details of the allegations for which Orhii was invited were still sketchy as of press time, the source disclosed that he learned that the NAFDAC boss is accused of awarding contracts to companies linked with him.
He was still being quizzed as at the time of filing this report, amid fears that he might be detained by EFCC.
Wilson Uwujaren, spokesman of the agency, could not be reached for confirmation, as his phone was switched off.
Orhii becomes the latest high-profile Nigerian to be grilled by EFCC in just two months of Muhammadu Buhari’s presidency.
Kingsley Kuku, former special adviser on Niger Delta Affairs to former President Goodluck Jonathan, was invited for questioning alongside two others on July 24 for allegedly embezzling and fraudulently diverting funds running into hundreds of millions of naira. He has already affirmed his innocence and has promised to report to the agency once he returns from the United States, where he is recuperating after a knee surgery.
Last Tuesday, Toyin Saraki, wife of the Senate president, was interrogated by EFCC for about six hours over her alleged involvement in shady contracts during her husband’s tenure as governor of Kwara between 2003 and 2011.
Murtala Nyako, former governor of Adamawa state, and his son Abdulaziz are also under EFCC investigation, as is Ikedi Ohakim, former governor of Imo state.
Martin Elechi, former governor of Ebonyi state, was interrogated in June.
