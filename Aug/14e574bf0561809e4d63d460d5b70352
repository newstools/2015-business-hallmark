The Permanent Secretary of FCT, Mr John Chukwu, has assured the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, that the Federal Government will handover the damaged United Nations Common Building in six months. Chukwu gave the assurance shortly after laying a wreath in honour of the victims of the unfortunate bomb attack on the UN House on August 26, 2011. He said the Federal Government would do everything possible to ensure that the renovation and reconstruction work was completed within the period of six months. He challenged the contractor, Julius Berger Nigeria, to work round the clock even if it means running three shifts to complete the work in order to put that sad event behind. “The contractors already said they will need between five to eight months to get the job fixed, but I have asked them to fast track their approach by working 24 hours to get it done within five months. “We cannot afford to delay here anymore, this project is very important because Nigeria government is committed to its obligations,” he said. The permanent secretary reiterated that the FCT Administration and the UN had sorted out all grey areas at meetings with UN experts. The Division Manager of the Julius Berger, Mr Marco Braun, assured that with adequate funding the firm would deliver. The solemn wreath laying is part of the UN Secretary-General’s programme in Nigeria. (NAN)
