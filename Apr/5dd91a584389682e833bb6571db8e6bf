With the impending re-engagement of Stephen Keshi as the Super Eagles coach, former Nigeria manager, Adegboye Onigbinde believes the out-of-contract coach has now become wiser and would make amend regarding his relationship with players especial those that are considered not to be on his good book. Keshi’s man-management skill was severely questioned during his first stint that saw him move from hero to zero following his winning of the 2013 AFCON and the failure to qualify for the 2015 edition held earlier in the year. The former Togo coach is expected to pen a new two-year deal that would take him to the end of the 2017 AFCON in Gabon in what will put an end to one of the most prolonged contract saga in international football.
Onigbinde, who himself was a two-time coach of Nigeria, said the Big Boss should not be too bossy this time around stressing he should rather strive to win the heart of Nigeria soccer fans.
“We know how players of nowadays behave because they can easily sabotage a coach in order to have a sort of payback if they are having an issue with the coach.
Keshi needs to act like a father to all the players all the time. He underestimate some of the player which was part of the reasons that made things go wrong for him the last time,” Onigbinde said.
He however expressed support for the coach to succeed giving the fact that he will be keen to prove to his critics that the failure to qualify Nigeria to the last Nations Cup was just a blip.
New NFF scribe, Sanusi Mohammed told the media that the singing of a new contract, which would see the coach earning N5m monthly, will be done by Friday in Abuja. Keshi, as part of the contract, would also be reporting to the Technical Committee of the NFF.
