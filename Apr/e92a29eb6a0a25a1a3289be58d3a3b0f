The winner of the Women’s World Gurning Championship Anne Woods has passed away after a lifetime of dominating competition from all over the globe to be crowned the ‘World’s Ugliest Woman’ a whopping 28 times. Anne was renowned for performing to her signature track You’re Gorgeous. Her first appearance was in 1977, her four-minute performances appeared to have taken their toll when she suddenly fell to the ground outside the competition room during a 2010 event. She battled on though and continued to enter her beloved competition despite health concerns. To mark her legacy, the Crab Fair committee will discuss ways to remember her at September’s event. Secretary and vice-chairman, Callum Scott, said: “Anne was very popular in the town and Crab Fair will not be the same this year. Anne couldn’t sit in the audience and watch the gurning as she was so popular. She was very passionate. We will be doing something in her name at this year’s event.”
