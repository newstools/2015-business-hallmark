The Chairman, Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Dr Sam Amadi,  on Monday in Abuja, attributed the continuous reduction in power supply in the country to low level of power generation and vandalism. Amadi said this while addressing newsmen during the inaugural meeting of the Nigerian Electricity Consumer Advocacy Network (NECAN).  Amadi, however, assured Nigerians that in the next two to three years there would be improvement in the power supply. “ Lights are going down. This is understandable. We don’t have enough capacity for everyone in this country. “I think we should just be truthful. We will get to a point where we have stable light. “ If you are generating 3,500 or 4,000 megawatts, there is no way the light will be stable across the country. We don’t have the product called power for many reasons. “You know, partly due to gas vandalisation; partly because we are still building the power plants; they are not all there. “ So, even if you have 6, 000megawatts, we will still not have a 100 per cent reliable electricity supply. “Our work is to ensure that we keep improving, building regulatory framework. “With the way this is being addressed today, we hope that in the next two or three years, Azura will come in and some other generations will come in. “But above all, that is why we have started the embedded generation regulation to allow for small modular power links to cumulatively yield more power for Nigerians.” He said NERC would ensure better billing and metering for consumers in the country, adding that that was the essence of NECAN. He said the network would help strengthen consumer voice so they would help to make sure the DISCOS were efficiently supplying the limited supply of electricity in the country. Mr Ganiyu Makanjuola, the National Coordinator, Electricity Consumer Enlightenment Initiative, dwelt on the provision of metering for consumers.
