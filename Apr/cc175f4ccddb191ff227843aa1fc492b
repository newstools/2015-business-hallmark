The United States Vice President Joe Biden has assured the
President-elect, Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari(retd.), that the US
government is willing and ready to work with him.
Biden gave this assurance when he made a phone call during a phone to
Buhari on Wednesday.
In a statement made available to newsmen by the White House on
Thursday, the US vice president spoke with the All Progressives
Congress (APC) standard bearer and winner of the March 28 presidential
poll to congratulate him on his victory in the recent election “and
affirm that the United States stands ready to expand collaboration
with Nigeria on issues of common concern, including economic and
security matters.”
Biden commended Buhari for his leadership in helping to ensure the
elections were conducted peacefully and urged him to continue to
foster a smooth, inclusive, and peaceful transition with President
Goodluck Jonathan.
The statement added, “The Vice President expressed the United States’
support for Nigeria’s efforts to counter Boko Haram, recover hostages
held by the group, and protect civilian populations. The Vice
President also expressed the willingness of the United States to
partner more closely with Nigeria to strengthen its economy.”
Earlier in the week, the President-elect had said Nigeria would work
closely with the US government especially in the area of security.
