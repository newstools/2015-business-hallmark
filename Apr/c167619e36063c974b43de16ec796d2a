Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State, Mr. Godwin Sidi, has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of colluding with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to shift the assembly polls in some constituencies in the state.
Sidi, who is a former publicity secretary of the defunct New PDP, made the accusation at a press conference in Yenagoa yesterday.
He said the reasons adduced by INEC in the state for postponing eight constituency polls were not tenable, insisting that INEC should explain the whereabouts of election materials which necessitated the shift.
The INEC had in a statement  issued by the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr. Baritor Kpagih, on Friday rescheduled elections in eight state constituencies in the state.
The affected constituencies are Ekeremor Constituencies 1, 2 and 3; Kolokuma/Opokuma constituencies 1 and 2; Sagbama constituencies 1 and 2; and Southern Ijaw Constituency 1.
Kpagih had explained that the shift in the affected constituencies in four local government areas of the state was in agreement with the stance by stakeholders that no election should take place in the constituencies without full complement of ballot papers.
But Sidi said, “there is a kind of alliance theory between INEC and the PDP. We want to know why the materials provided by INEC headquarters were not available for the state.
“We felt it could be a strategy to manipulate the polls.”
He called on party faithful to be law abiding, stressing that APC would resist any attempt to intimidate and arrest members.
