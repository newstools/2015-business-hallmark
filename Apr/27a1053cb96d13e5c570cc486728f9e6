 Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) Chief Tony Okoroji has compiled his weekly articles in Saturday Independent into a book and booked May 24, 2915 for its presentation.
The book which dwells more on the critical moments of the 2015 electioneering campaigns, the comic events, the intrigues, the key personalities, etc, according to a statement from his stable, is a collectors’ item.
‘Every individual interested in the political history of Nigeria ought to read this book titled “ON THE ROAD TO CHANGE”. In it will be found the foretelling of the factors that led to the first electoral defeat of an incumbent Head of State in Nigerian history and the takeover of the political landscape by APC. “ON THE ROAD TO CHANGE” will be launched at a five star event holding at Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Sunday, May 24, 2015, the beginning of the week of the handover of the reins of power to General Muhammadu Buhari. The Network of friends of Chief Tony Okoroji of which I am proud to be a member, is leaving no stone unturned to make sure that the key prime movers of the progressive movement in Nigeria are invited to this ‘one in a million’ book launch. Everyone invited to the event is promised a most memorable event with the finest entertainment to be found anywhere.
