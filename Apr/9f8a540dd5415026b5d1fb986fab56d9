  In a daring and precise operation, Nigerian troops yesterday stormed the Sambisa Forest and rescued about 300 women and girls. It was gathered that at least three major terrorist camps have been destroyed in the well-coordinated attacks that included the destruction of the notorious Tokumbere camp in the Sambisa Forest. While confirming the operation the Director, Defence Information, Major General Chris Olukolade said he could not confirm the identity of the freed victims and their origins and he could not state if any of them was from Chibok until after thorough screening and proper investigations. “Troops this afternoon rescued 200 girls and 93 women from Sambisa Forest. We cannot confirm if the Chibok girls are in this group. “Troops captured and destroyed 3 terrorist camps including the notorious Tokumbere camp in the Sambisa Forest Operation. “We are yet to determine their origin as all the freed persons are now being screened and profiled. Please don’t misquote me on their origin. We will provide more details later.”
