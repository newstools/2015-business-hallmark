The position of the Independent National Electoral Commission that aggrieved candidates over the just concluded election results should seek redress in the law courts is a welcome development. I am of the opinion that it is right to contest an election and fail, but it is a mark of injustice and a crime to ride on another person’s mandate. People might not be enthusiastic to vote in future if they are not sure that their votes will count. Many Nigerians believe that their votes never count, hence our judiciary system should rise to the challenges of restoring people’s confidence.
