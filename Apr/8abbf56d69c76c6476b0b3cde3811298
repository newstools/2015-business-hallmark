 Still smarting from the loss of the presidential election to the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Adamu Muazu, has admitted that his party was humbled by the loss. The PDP Chairman, fondly called, “The Game Changer”, however vowed that the party will bounce back and that the party will reform in order to meet the expectations of Nigerians. Muazu also stressed the fact that the PDP has learnt its lessons from the defeat, promising not to let Nigerians down again. The PDP boss stated these in a series of tweets on his twitter handle, @Muazuaa. In one of the tweets, Muazu said, “We are humbled by the 28th of March decision of many Nigerians and promise never again let you down. We will reform our party. “We have learnt some very useful lessons with the March 28th elections and we want to assure Nigerians you will see a new PDP.” Meanwhile, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Prof. Yemi Akinseye (SAN), has urged the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to exercise caution in accepting defectors from other political parties. Akinseye, a fellow of Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, made call in Abuja. He said that the spate of defection into the party was getting worrisome.
