 The kidnapped Chairman of Ogbia, the local government area of President Goodluck Jonathan, in Bayelsa State, Mr. Anya Abah, has been released by his abductors. Abah was kidnapped by a four-man gang on April 22 along Otuasega-Okaki road in the council. His police orderly reportedly abandoned him and fled following deafening gunshots fired by the hoodlums. The abductors dragged him out of his vehicle at gunpoint and took him to Okarki in neighbouring Rivers State where they whisked him away in a waiting speedboat. It was, however, gathered that the chairman was set free by his abductors at about 8.45pm on Sunday along the Ogonoko waterside in Abua/Odua Local Government Area of Rivers State. The state’s Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Butswat Asinim, said the abducted chairman was abandoned by his kidnappers. He said the assailants, sensing that the special force of the state’s Anti-Kidnapping Squad was closing in on them, abandoned the chairman and fled. “Our policemen were on ground after adequate intelligence gathering. We beefed our searchlight on the area because of earlier intelligence gathered. The kidnappers got scared and abandoned their victim,” he said. He said the victim’s sister had earlier informed the police authority of attempts by the kidnappers to collect a ransom.
