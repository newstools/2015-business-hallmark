When completed and officially launched, Hallmark Life gathered, the company will join the others in the production of bottled water and fruit juices. Adetu who confirmed that it will be ready before the year runs out described the project as a big one. ‘’Mr Okoye has invested heavily on it, it’s actually a subsidiary of P-Classic Group (PCG), a fast-growing and dynamic company owned by him,’’ he added. Many Nigerians are commending him for the gesture in view that artistes hardly invest for the future but live ostentatious lives.any of them forget that theirs is not a pensionable profession until it is too late,  It is one that has a killer glamour, so every artiste must think about tomorrow first,’’ some of them advised.
