By Our Correspondent In a dramatic escalation of the desperation to win the re-scheduled
governorship elections in Abia state, residents of Aba woke up this
morning to see threatening coffins covered with white and red pieces of cloth and on which eggs were also placed at strategic road junctions within and around the city. Attached to the life-threatening symbol were notes predicting doom and death for anyone who dares vote against their son and PDP candidate in the forthcoming polls, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu. Eye-witness accounts reveal that the appearance of the spectacle on the streets of Aba has shocked many residents to the bone marrow even as they ponder the implications and otherwise of this dramatic turn of events. Analysts see the contest this Saturday as a straight one between Dr. Alex Otti of the All Progressives Grand Alliance and Okezie Ikpeazu of the Peoples Democratic Party. Contacted, a source close to the Ikpeazu campaign dismissed the insinuation that the coffin threat was associated with their candidate. “How can that be? How will he do such a thing and put his name on it? This a gimmick. It is part of the campaign to discredit our candidate and it will not work. They should rather focus on the 177, 000 people that are voting on saturday. the security people should investigate this matter and tell us what is going on,” he said.
