By Demola Akinyemi The gubernatorial aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Kwara State, who defected to the All Progressives Congress, APC, before last weekend elections, Sen. Gbemisola Rukayyah Saraki, has said the victory of General Muhammadu Buhari candidate has put paid to the prediction that Nigeria will disintegrate just as she commended Nigerians for ensuring “ the country’s arguably most credible elections in history.” Ahead of next Saturday gubernatorial and House of Assembly polls, Gbemisola charged   INEC to ensure that “ administrative lapses identified in the last elections are corrected. The security agencies are also advised to continue to be non-partisan and professional in carrying out their duties”, she added. She spoke in a press statement issued by his media aide,Comrade Abdulkareem Alabi in Ilorin, Kwara State capital. <img class="size-full wp-image-148038" src="https://cdn2.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/250x363xGbemisola-Saraki.jpg.pagespeed.ic.EIJjwUGGQ6.webp" alt="Gbemisola Saraki" width="250" height="363" /> The statement went on: “These elections and the maturity that played out between the two camps has effectively put paid to prediction that Nigeria might disintegrate this year. Against apprehensions, the elections   have turned out to be a rebirth of our destiny as against the fear of our apocalypse. “In its infamous 17-page discussion paper entitled: `Mapping Sub-Saharan Africa’s Future’, a United State Security Think Tank, the National Intelligence Council (NIC) had, in 2009, predicted that our country might disintegrate. “But in the face of daunting challenges, Nigeria has proudly proved it’s worth to the world as a nation of prized values. Yet again, we have proven to be a beacon of hope for the African continent.   It is heartwarming that Nigeria has gained a renewed global respect for conducting its most credible elections in history. “Nigerians must also note importantly that the change that we all yearn for starts with us. All Nigerians, and not President Buhari or the All Progressives Congress (APC) alone must key into the change spirit by being better ambassadors of the country wherever we find ourselves.  – See more at: http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/04/general-elections-proved-doomsday-prophets-wrong-gbemi-saraki/#sthash.FZxU9T1k.dpuf
