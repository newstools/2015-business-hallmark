Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, the Ondo State Governor, has debunked speculations that some of the commissioners in his cabinet will soon defect to the All Progressives Congress, following the lead of deputy governor, Alli Olanusi. Mimiko, in a media interview in Akure, said Olanusi’s defection has not affected the allegiance of his commissioners to him and his PDP. He appealed to the people of the state to vote en masse for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidates in the forthcoming Governorship and House of Assembly elections. The governor said this was necessary to ensure further promotion of peace and effective governance in the state. “Voting for our candidates will guarantee continuity of peace and prospects for the state. “The people should demonstrate their desire to maintain and further promote peace and growth in the state by voting for the PDP candidates jostling for seats in the state’s legislative chamber,” he said. Mimiko thanked the people for their support and noted that if the PDP had majority in the State Assembly, it would promote mutual cooperation and sound synergy between the legislative and executive arms of government. The governor had earlier in his Easter message, urged the people to make the events marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ hitch-free by celebrating with caution. He implored the people to emulate the love demonstrated by God to mankind by making His son a sacrifice for the sins of the world.
