 In response to the continuous xenophobic attacks on Africans in South Africa, President Goodluck Jonathan Has been advised by the House to, as a matter of urgency, recall Nigeriaâ€™s High Commissioner to the country pending when the attacks will stop. The lawmakers warned that Nigeria would no longer tolerate killings of its citizens. The resolution followed the adoption of the prayers (as amended) of a motion of urgent matter of public importance by the Chairman, House Committee on Diaspora Matters, Abike Dabiri-Erewa. It is sad that the recent attacks that has left many dead, businesses and shops vandalised, many beaten up, was incited by a statement by the South African Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini. The King was alleged to have ordered African migrants to return their country as they are no longer welcome in South Africa. In their resolution, the lawmakers also appealed to the federal government to apply the diplomatic principle of reciprocity in dealing with South Africa. The lawmakers added that if South Africa continues to frustrate Nigeria businesses, Nigeria must also do the same to South Africa businesses in the country. In addition, the lawmakers stated Nigeria frowns at the attacks and will no longer tolerate the killing of its nationals in South Africa. President Goodluck Jonathan must immediately convey this to President Zuma as a matter of urgency.
