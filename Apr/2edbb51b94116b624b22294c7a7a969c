Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose has said that whoever wants to impeach him must first impeach God. Fayose stated this on Monday, April 6, during a programme, “Meet Your Governor”, which was aired across the state. “I’m like Israel that is in the midst of enemies but will always prevail. Whoever wants to remove me will first have to impeach God,” Fayose said. “They are doing all these just to get at me because of my support for President Jonathan and I have no regret for supporting the president. Let me say it again, I have not been served any impeachment notice,” he added. “The House of Assembly is also on recess and Dr Adewale Omirin is not the speaker of the State House of Assembly. Omirin is in court, challenging his impeachment and he can’t be challenging his impeachment in court and at the same time laying claim to being Speaker,” the governor said. Fayose was speaking in response to recent attempts by the 19All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmakers in the state to impeach him. The legislators, who returned to the state after the APC’s victory in the March 28 and 29 Presidential elections, have said that there’s no going back on plans to impeach Fayose. Culled from Pulse.ng
