 Benue State Governor, Gabriel Suswam, has donated eight brand new Toyota Prado SUVs to the Governor-Elect, Chief Samuel Ortom; his wife; the Deputy Governor-Elect, Benson Abounu, and his wife, as part of measures to ensure peaceful transition arrangement. This presentation was made by the Governor on Thursday at the State House in Makurdi in the face of the heavy criticism his administration has faced for owing salaries of workers for over six months. Student of the state-owned tertiary institutions are reported to be currently out of schools following the strike embarked upon by the lecturers as a result of non-payment of their salaries. This, among others, are believed to number among the reasons why Suswam, who vied for one of the senatorial seats in the state was defeated at the polls with his anointed successor also suffering the same fate at the governorship elections. While presenting the vehicles, the governor declared his full support to the aspiration of his estranged political benefactor and Senate Minority Leader, George Akume to lead the 8th National Assembly when inaugurated in June. He reasoned that since there was nobody from the state vying for the position, he was supporting Akume, his predecessor as state governor, to emerge victorious. “My way of playing politics is all encompassing and I am fully in support of Akume to emerge as the Senate President for the 8th Assembly since he is the only person from Benue vying for that position, which we understand has been zoned to the North Central.” While calling on the media to continue to encourage peace and issue-based understanding among different political parties in the country, he tasked journalists to extend the same support and cooperation the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, enjoyed to the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the interest of peaceful existence of Nigeria. “I want you people (the media) to extend the same support and cooperation our government enjoyed to the incoming administration of APC in the interest of the nation,” he stated.
