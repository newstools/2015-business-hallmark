The Enugu State House of Assembly has directed the Commissioner of Police
in the state to arrest the Accountant-General, Mr Paschal Okolie, for
failing to appear before it for the third time. The Leader of the assembly, Mr Sunday Ude-Okoye (PDP-Awgu North), moved the
motion for the issuance of a warrant of arrest on the accountant-general
during plenary on Wednesday in Enugu. Ude-Okoye said the arrest became imperative because of his consistent
failure to appear before the assembly. “We are all from Enugu State and every time he pretends to be sick, but we
keep getting information that he attends to his duty. “This is the third invitation to him and there is no sign or reason why he
is not here. As of today, he is in Enugu State. “Maybe as one of us said yesterday that we have no powers, he feels that we
have no powers indeed and he will continue to fry us like ‘akara’ in the
frying pan. “So because of his continuous failure and neglect of this honourable House,
l therefore evoke the powers bestowed on us to order the Commissioner of
Police to issue a warrant of arrest on the accountant-general,” he said Ude-Okoye, therefore, moved that the accountant-general should be brought
before the assembly on April 21. The motion, which was seconded by Chief John Anichukwu (PDP-Nkanu East),
was put to vote and was unanimously passed by the lawmakers. It would be recalled that Okolie was invited by the lawmakers to explain
why he decided to withhold the assembly’s monthly subvention.
