A Peoples Democratic Party stalwart in Delta State, Chief Ladina Yebu, has called on the people of the state to rally round the state Governor, Emmanuel Ewetan Uduaghan, in the effort to reposition the act regulating the activities of the Delta State Oil Producing Area Development Commission (DESOPADEC).
While commending the governor for initiating the bill presently before the State House of Assembly, he said that the bill would not only reduce communal crisis, but also ensure that those from oil producing areas get their full benefits and also correct the defects that presently characterized the bill regulating the commission
Addressing newsmen in Benin City, Edo State, Yebu, a member of an oil producing area and former special assistant to the governor said, “I commend the governor for his courage and relentless efforts geared towards revamping the Oil Producing Area Development Commission in order to put it in the position to discharge its set goals for the benefits of the people of the oil producing areas in the state. “My commendation and full support become necessary in view of the fact that the governor has placed a bill before the Delta State House of Assembly to correct many defects that have been observed in the former law that established DESOPADEC, where many things were found to have been working against the smooth and effective operations of the commission.” He however noted that though Delta State is one of Nigeria’s largest crude oil and natural gas producing states in the country, the huge revenue accruing from the natural resources has also become sources of communal frictions as communities struggle to overcome undercurrent deals and short changing that leave them perpetually under the stronghold of underdevelopment. “The present bill, in my view, will help to effect changes that over the past years have not been seen and which are much needed to bring positive developments and improvements in the socio-economic lives of the people of communities that are directly affected by the exploration and exploitation of crude oil in the state.”
Yebu, therefore, called for total support for Uduaghan and his government in his bid to improve the lives of the people of Delta State.
