The Africa Travel Association (ATA), the leading travel industry trade association, working in collaboration and partnership with the African Union in promoting tourism to Africa, continues its partnership with AKWAABA, the leading annual international travel fair in West Africa, to market and promote tourism to West Africa. Known as the place “where Africa meets the world”, AKWAABA is dedicated to linking the world to Africa by bringing together travelers, airlines, hotels, restaurants, tour operators, travel agents, state tourism boards, foreign trade and tourism sectors in Nigeria, West- Africa and Africa. In light of challenges faced by African destinations in the past year, particularly West Africa, the show organizers are delighted to highlight the leading tourism developments, products, and suppliers to show that West Africa is open and ready for business. In 2014, AKWAABA attracted exhibitors from over 20 countries and over 15,000 attendees. The 2015 program will be expanded to feature Africa Travel Awards, a Spa Africa Day, a Wedding Show, Wine Tasting, an Africa Business Travel Association Workshop, a Hospitality & Aviation Forum, as well as Country Day Celebrations. “ATA is delighted to once again partner with AKWAABA during its eleventh anniversary to support travel and tourism in West Africa,” said Edward Bergman, ATA Executive Director.
