Nasarawa State Governor, Alhaji Tanko Al-Makura, on Wednesday said the Yoruba in the South-west were behind the successful outing of the All Progressives Congress (APC) during the recently concluded general election in the country. The governor made this statement at the Presidential Lodge in Lafia, the state capital, on Tuesday night while receiving the Yoruba community in the state led by their President, Alhaji Afees Adigun. In making this assertion, the governor stressed the role played by Yoruba elements during the merger process of opposition political parties which transformed into the  APC saying their contribution “could not be quantified in naira and kobo. “I cannot forget the role our Yoruba brothers played during my reelection campaigns and I will forever remain grateful to them. Despite that you, the Yorubas People are not originally from Nasarawa State, you have appreciated the projects executed by this administration in the past four years and have given us your supports,” Al-Makura further stated. The governor went on to say that apart from the monumental achievements of APC-led governments in various states, which saw the party triumphed phenomenally at the polls, Nigerians were truly yearning for change due to the confidence and trust they have reposed on the president-elect,  Muhammadu Buhari. Earlier at the occasion, the leader of the Yoruba group, who  is also the Special Assistant to the governor on national integration, Afeez Adigun, said Al-Makura’s commitment to the development of the state prompted the Yoruba community to give him and other APC candidates unflinching support during the election.
