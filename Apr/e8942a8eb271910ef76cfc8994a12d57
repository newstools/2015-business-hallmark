The battle for the control of Alausa Glass House, the seat of government in Lagos, the nation’s commercial nerve center and ‘no man’s land (forget if someone threatens to invoke the lagoon over non indigenes), was unmistakably one of the hottest. Well. it was eventually won and lost with nobody falling in and out of the lagoon.  But shortly before the voters filed out for the battle, some of our celebrity artistes opened up on their expectations. Sound Sultan – We need a governor that is accessible. Kiss Daniel – Ambode or Agbaje, all we need is a better Lagos King Blaze – The two main candidates are good. Let the people decide but it shouldn’t be a d or die affair. Oritsafemi  –  I was simply scared to vote. Etta Alfred – I voted but my ‘tree’ could not make the forest. Let the winner realize that Nigerians are one, irrespective of where they come from.
