The Nigerian troops supported by the Air Force, fighting the Boko Haram insurgents, have recaptured the towns of Bita, Izge, Yamteke and Uba in Askira and Damboa Local Government Areas of Borno State. A press statement by the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, Colonel Usman Kukasheka, said that this was a last push to capture Sambisa forest which has been a major stronghold of the terrorists. He said one soldier died in the encounter while ten others sustained injuries. Similarly, many of the Boko Haram terrorists were killed and recoveries were made. The Nigerian Army has also enjoined all Nigerians to remain law abiding and continue to discharge their civic obligation of voting for the candidates of their choice without any fear. The Army gave this charge ahead of Saturday’s governorship and state assembly elections, for which they have reassured the public that their security is guaranteed. Col. Kukasheka directed all formations to remain vigilant and act within the law to prevent any attempt to endanger the lives of Nigerians wherever they may be. He also called on all Army personnel on election duties to discharge their duties professionally and within the confines of election duties and code of conduct of the military.
