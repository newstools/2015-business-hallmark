 Dangote Group has completed construction of Africa’s biggest tomato-processing plant.  It is a 1,200 metric ton installed capacity factory in Kadawa-Bunkure axis of the Kano State. The plant according to the company is expected to reduce the country’s dependence on tomato paste and puree import. The company revealed that the 1,200 metric ton installed capacity factory has been built in the Staple Crop Processing Zone Development (SCPZ). The development of this special processing zone is one of the focus points of the Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) of President Goodluck Jonathan. The idea is to attract private sector investments into modern processing of locally produced crops, livestock, fisheries and related agribusiness activities. It is however expected that the new tomato-processing factory will create price stability for tomato farmers when they harvest and they will do more than one cropping season hence forth. The presence of the factory will encourage farmers to produce more. According to a food engineer working at the plant, AshwinPatil, the impact of the processing plant will be felt across the agriculture value chain. He added that the plant will create price sta­bility for tomato farmers when they harvest and they will do more than one cropping season hence­forth.
