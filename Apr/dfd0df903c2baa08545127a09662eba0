 Erudite lawyer and human rights activist, Femi Falana (SAN), has faulted the decision of President Goodluck Jonathan to formally handover to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari on May 28, noting that it would create a power vacuum for the few hours between when he hands over and the morning of May 29 when his successor will be formally sworn-in as the president. Minister of Information, Mrs. Patricia Akwashiki, while briefing State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, yesterday, disclosed that President Jonathan would formally handover to his successor, Muhammadu Buhari on May 28 at a dinner. She added that he had directed all ministries, departments and agencies, MDAs, of the federal government to submit their handover briefs to the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, on or before April 20. But speaking on the May 28 handover date preferred by Jonathan, the Senior Advocate asserted that the new date was a deviation from the law as a void would be created should he go ahead and handover before Buhari’s swearing in. According to him, “As far as the law is concerned, President Jonathan is in charge of the country until May 29. He cannot cut short his presidency in the name of handing over the day before at a dinner, as there is no provision for a vacuum. “He is the president till the morning of May 29 when Buhari takes the oath of office. There is no provision for a vacuum of eight or nine hours, and I am sure the president will be properly advised,” Falana stated.
