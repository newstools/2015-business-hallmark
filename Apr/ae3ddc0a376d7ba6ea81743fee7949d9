 Some manufacturers of made-in-Nigeria cars may soon join their counterparts globally as they have commenced exporting their vehicles to other African Countries. The Director General, National Automotive Council (NAC), AlhajiAminuJacal disclosed this in a stakeholders meeting in Lagos recently. Jacal said anNnewi-based car manufacturing company, Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM) Company is already in the lead as they have also exported their brands to neighbouring Ghana, while another Nigerian based manufacturer is exporting to South Africa and Central African Republic for peace-keeping operations. “They are also exporting more Nigerian vehicles to Rwanda and in fact the President of Rwanda uses vehicles made in Nigeria,” he hinted, adding that although South Africa remains a hub of vehicle assembly in Africa but that in no distant time, Nigeria may take over as the highest vehicle manufacturer in the continent. The Director-General further stated that the council had carried out research in Economic Community of West African State (ECOWAS) countries on how to encourage vehicle exportation within the sub region, stressing that the Nigerian manufacturers were given incentives to encourage vehicle exportation although  other foreign investors are also involved in the arrangement. “The incentives we gave out to the various investors are to encourage export,  because in West Africa we are the only country that can establish assembly plants,” Jacal noted. According to him, “we don’t really need the import because when we eventually put things in order, import will just be a mere bonus,” He assured that prices of vehicles will be affordable to enable the people of the country to purchase theirs, saying that there is zero duty on issues surrounding electricity, importation of power equipment as a means of encouraging local assembly. Meanwhile, Vitafoam Nigeria Plc is set to venture into becoming a key player in the car manufacturing business.
