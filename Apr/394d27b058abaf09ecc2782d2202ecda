 United States vice president, Mr. Joe Biden, on Tuesday spoke with President Goodluck Jonathan on telephone to commend him for his roles in the successful conduct of Nigeria’s general election. A statement issued by the Public Affairs Section of the U.S embassy in Abuja, said the American vice president noted that President Jonathan’s decision to accept results of the March 28 presidential election  and congratulate the President-elect, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, as well as his steps to ensure a successful transition, have strengthened the country democracy and set a strong example for Africa and the world. He encouraged President Jonathan to continue playing leadership roles in global affairs after his exit from office on May 29. It would be recalled that the President had in a move that confounded even his hardest critics congratulated the President-elect before the Independent National Electoral Commission announced the winner of the election on March 31. The phone call that took place almost 10 hours before INEC officially declared Buhari the winner with a total of 15,424,921 votes against 12,853,162 for Jonathan doused tension that was gradually building up in many parts of the country. Although many argued that it took the prompting of U.S President, Barack Obama and British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, who repeatedly called Jonathan to concede defeat, before the President eventually put a call across to his All Progressive Congress rival at exactly 5:15pm on March 31, that move catapulted the President from villain – the status he acquired because of his poor handling of national affairs to national hero. Many had even described him as the “real hero” of Nigeria’s democratic process, alongside the INEC Chairman, Prof. Attahiru Jega and few others
