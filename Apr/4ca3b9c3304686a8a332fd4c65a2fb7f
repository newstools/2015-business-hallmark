Title sponsor of the Glo Premier League, Globacom, has commended the competitive spirit that has pervaded the 2014/15 season so far, saying it is a testimony to the improvement of the Glo Premier league. Teams such as Abia Warriors, Giwa FC of Jos and Taraba FC of Jalingo have recorded away victories in the league which entered Week Seven this Wednesday, while the usual top teams like Pillars FC of Kano, Enyimba FC of Aba and Dolphins FC of Port Harcourt are struggling for rhythm. “We are impressed that the excitement which heralded the new season has translated into impressive performances for some teams as they seek to upstage the traditional leaders,” Globacom said in a statement in Lagos on Wednesday. “We also believe that recent away victories recorded have given the Glo Premier League credibility and we expect that the teams that have achieved these feats will sustain the momentum, while hoping that the traditional leaders will rise up to the occasion,” the statement added. “Indeed, the likely resurgence of the traditional teams can only engender more competition and the trend will rub off on the standard of the league.” Globacom, however, says that the early ouster of the duo of Pillars and Enyimba from the CAF Champions League which the telecommunications company recently described as unfortunate will make them focus on the Glo Premier League as they re-contest for the top slots. “We hope they have recovered well from their early exit from CAF Champions League to give their best as they are used to,” the statement further said.” On the response of fans to league matches, Glo said: “The fans turnout at the stadia across the country is commendable and we task the teams to continue to give the fans enough reason to troop en masse to match venues.” The Company concluded by urging the League strikers to endeavour to increase the goal hauls this season as this will bring the league alive.
