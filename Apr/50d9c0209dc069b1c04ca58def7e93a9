A federal high court in Abuja has terminated two of the three suits challenging the eligibility of Muhammadu Buhari, the president-elect, to contest the 2015 presidential election. Ademola Adeniyi, the presiding judge, struck out the suits after the plaintiffs informed him of their decision to withdraw the case. Chukwunweike Okafor and Max Ozoaka‎ had filed separate suits seeking the disqualification of Buhari on the basis of his alleged failure to present his certificate of academic qualifications to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).  They claimed that the non-submission contravened provisions of Sections 131 and 318 of the 1999 constitution and Section 31(3) of the electoral act, 2010. However, through their lawyers – Mike Ozehkome and Chike Amobi, – they told the court on Wednesday that they decided to withdraw the matter in order not to distract Buhari from presiding over the affairs of the nation. culled from the cable
