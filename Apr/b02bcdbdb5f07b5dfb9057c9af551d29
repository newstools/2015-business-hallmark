 The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has blacklisted three centres accredited for the conduct of the recently concluded Computer Based Test (CBT) in the country. JAMB’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Fabian Benjamin, said yesterday in Lagos that the centres were axed over inadequate and sub-standard facilities for accreditation. “These three centres are located in the South-East, South-West and Abuja and have been blacklisted. “We noticed that owners of these centres, out of greed, presented to us facilities that did not belong to them just because they wanted to be part of the examination. “They were not sincere enough to let the organisers of the examination know that they did not have all the necessary backups needed by JAMB as a prerequisite for the accreditation of any centre that would want to host the examination. “These centres posed challenges to candidates who were to write the examination there, due to the inadequacies, and we quickly swung to action by relocating them,” he said. He said, however, that in spite of the initial hitches, the outcome of the examination was encouraging. Benjamin said the board would build on the success of the 2015 JAMB examination which was the CBT for all candidates. “We want to assure Nigerians that we shall be giving them one of the best CBT ever conducted in the country come 2016.
