The Eze Ndi Igbo in Lagos, Nwabueze Ohazulike, has appealed to Igbo residents in the state to remain calm ahead of Saturday’s gubernatorial election. In a press conference at his palace in Lagos, Wednesday, Mr. Ohazulike said that he was not part of the group of Eze Ndi Igbos who paid a courtesy visit to the Oba of Lagos on Sunday. “Eze Ndi Igbo of Lagos State, the head of the Eze Ndi Igbo structure in Lagos State, had no knowledge and was not involved nor invited to the so called courtesy visit to the first class Oba. This speaks volumes,” Mr. Ohazulike said. “The Igbos have a long history of cordial relationship in Lagos State with the Yoruba community and other Nigerians and shall continue to cherish such relationship and make concerted efforts to protect and enhance it and to continue to promote the spirit of unity of Nigerians, love, peace and inter-ethnic harmony in the state.” details shortly!  culled from premium times
