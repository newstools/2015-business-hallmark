The Independent National Electoral Commission has declared the All Progressive Grand Alliance as winner of 26 local government areas out of 30 in Anambra State in the State Assembly elections held on Saturday. INEC, therefore, rescheduled the remaining four LGAs in the state for April 18, 2015. Addressing newsmen at Awka on Sunday, the Resident Electoral Commissioner of INEC in the state, Mr. Edwin Nwatarali, listed the affected areas to include Aniocha Constituencies 1 and 2, Aguata 1 Constituency 1 and Ekwusigo Constituency. “Out of the 30 constituency seats in the Anambra State Assembly, 26 have been declared; and they were all won by APGA,” he said. He said the Commission had to move the Ekwusigo elections from April 25, which was its initial schedule to April 18 following a recommendation from the INEC headquarters. According to him, the Ekwusigo Constituency election was cancelled after thugs made away with over 75 per cent of the total electoral materials meant for the Saturday election. He said for Uga ward 1 in Aguata, there was an anomaly, as the number of voters exceeded the number of registered voters with Permanent Voters Card. For Aniocha Constituencies 1 and 2, Nwatarali said there was a deliberate attempt not to use card readers in the area despite certifications by technical personnel from INEC confirming the workability of the machines. “So, we are rejecting the result from these constituencies. Our card reader was working and yet over 80 per cent of accreditation was done manually,” he said, adding that the commission had enough technical personnel to address issues of such nature. He said for areas where the card readers had issues, the technical team of the commission succeeded in fixing the anomalies before the voting exercise was concluded.
