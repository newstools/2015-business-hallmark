The President of the Nigeria Internet Registration Association (NIRA),
Mrs Mary Uduma, on Wednesday said the association engaged in 8,559 .ng
domain names activities in the first quarter of 2015.
Uduma said in Lagos that there was an increase of 755 activities,
compared to last quarter of 2014 which had a record of 7,804.
She said that of the 8,559 .ng domain names recorded in the first
quarter, 4,859 were registration, 3,547 were for renewal, while 153
were transfers.
The NIRA president said a breakdown of the first quarter record showed
that a total of 2,653 domain activities were performed in January.
According to her, the 2,653 domain name activities were 1,542
registrations; 1,070 renewals and 41 transfers.
She said that a total of 2,605 .ng domain name activities were carried
out in February, comprising of 1,512 registrations; 1,048 renewals and
45 transfers.
Uduma added that in March, 3,301 domain activities were recorded of
which 1,805 were .ng domain name registrations, 1,429 were for
renewals and 67 were transfers from other domains to .ng domain.
“With more appreciation of the Nigerian Identity on the Internet as
the year progresses, more activities will be noted within the domain
name industry.
“With increased public interest, greater awareness drive and some
outlined outreach programmes, Nigeria is positioned for growth in this
business this year. There is no doubt that the numbers will increase
greatly this year,” she said.
The NIRA president said that .ng (like our currency Naira and +234
country code) was the official Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN) approved country code Top Level Domain (ccTLD) for
Nigeria.
According to her, the availability of names is better on the .ng ccTLD
than on the generic top-level domain (gTLD) like .com, .org.
She added that with the .ng domain name, branding and geo-targeting of
local content to the Nigerian market would be made easier.
“With the .ng, our primary DNS servers are secured and locally
managed with multiple cast servers located around the world,” Uduma
said.
She said that hosting businesses on the .ng would help to support the
Nigerian economy and provide jobs for local Information Technology
(IT) professionals.
