The Director General of the National Sport Commission, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye, has tasked the national U-23 team and the Super Falcons to ensure they win gold medals for Nigeria in the male and female football events of the All Africa Games taking place in September in Congo Brazzaville. “The National Sports Commission is very happy with the qualification of the teams,” Elegbeleye told National Mirror yesterday. “We commended their efforts, determination, zeal and patriotism for ensuring Nigeria’s flag is flown in the competition,” he added. “We are also charging them to go to Congo Brazzaville to complete the job they have started well by winning the gold medals at stake in their respective competitions. “We believe they can do it over there and as usual the NSC will continue to encourage Nigerian sports men and women to continue to win laurels for their fatherland. “I am also urging the other sports that are still battling to qualify for the All Africa Games to put in their best to get the qualification tickets and make Nigeria proud.”
